            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is a very juſt Cenſure that <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> paſs'd upon <hi>Phylarchus,</hi> one that wrote the Hiſtory of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaian</hi> War, That he did not underſtand the principal Buſineſs of an Hiſtorian, becauſe he conceal'd all the vertuous and generous Actions of one Side,<note place="margin">Polyb. l. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and inſiſted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon ſuch as might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them odious to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: the Rigor and Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Execution which the <hi>Achaians</hi> were ſometimes obliged to uſe, are ſet out with all the miſerable Circumſtances that can be conceived on ſuch Occaſions; but not a word of their Clemency and Humanity which they commonly us'd towards their Enemies, when they fell into their Power: As if, ſays that Noble Writer, <hi>It were the Office of an Hiſtorian to record only the Worſt of Humane Actions,
<pb facs="tcp:64435:3"/>to reckon up the Faults and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of Men, and not their great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Actions;<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and as if the Examples of Sin might be of greater Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and Edification to the Reader than thoſe of Goodneſs and Vertue.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter's Hiſtory of Biſhops and their Councils,</hi> being writ after the ſame Model, falls una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably under the ſame Reproof, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perhaps the Diſingenuity that is condemn'd in a Heathen, may become a Chriſtian Writer; and what the one muſt not do to his Enemy, the other may offer to his Brethren and Fathers, to the great Lights and Ornaments of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>Now this Hiſtory of Biſhops is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an Account of all the Faults that Biſhops have committed in the ſeveral Ages of the Church, without any mention of their good Actions, of the piety and ſeverity of their lives, of their Zeal for the Faith, of their Charity towards the Poor, of their Contempt
<pb facs="tcp:64435:3"/>of the World, of their Labor and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in their Office. Theſe were things he thought, perhaps, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a Church-Hiſtorian to relate: Theſe were improper, unedifying Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, at leaſt wiſe they were not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable to the Deſign of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, which was, <hi>to diſgrace Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Epiſcopacy.</hi> This Weeding of Church-Hiſtory for the Faults of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, is not to write, or abridge Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, but to draw up an Indictment; and becauſe many things are falſly charg'd, it is no better than a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell.</p>
            <p>But we need not look for a ſeverer Cenſure of this <hi>Church-Hiſtory,</hi> than that we have in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own Critical Preface to it: For as his Church Hiſtory is deſign'd to diſgrace Dioceſan Biſhops and their Councils, ſo the Preface looks as it were intended to diſgrace this Hiſtory: For the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of a <hi>Credible Hiſtorian,</hi> which he reckons up there, appear ſo little in our Abridger, and the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Incredible Relators ſo nearly reſemble him, that one might ſuſpect a
<pb facs="tcp:64435:4"/>Trick in it; and that ſome of <hi>Tom Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryat's</hi> Enſurers had given their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the Work.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. It is ſuppoſed</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>B.</hi>) <hi>that a Man ſhould believe his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> Surely our Author was aſleep when he wrote this, and thought he ſaw every thing he relates. But how ſhall we believe our Sences, ſince we are told, in this Hiſtory, that they were not <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> but Epiſcopal Men that began the late War againſt the King?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. The Hiſtory of the Goſpel is certainly credible.</hi> This would migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily enſure the Credit of this Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if all were Goſpel that Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> writes.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3. Prophets who had Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and Viſion, had that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that gave them a Certainty, tho not to others.</hi> It may be Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has heard a <hi>Bene ſcripſiſti de me;</hi> but becauſe he confeſſes this to be no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to others, we may ſuſpend our Faith; and upon Examniation believe as much as we ſhall find reaſon to do.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:64435:4"/>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4. When Hiſtory delivers a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact and Sence by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Conſent of all thoſe that knew it, tho' of contrary Minds, Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Intereſt.</hi> The Superiority of Biſhops over Presbyters is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> Men of very <hi>contrary Minds, Diſpoſition and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;</hi> and yet this Church Hiſtory would have us believe the contrary: Here we are in a Streight: For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall we belive in this Caſe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face or the Book?</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5. When the Hiſtory of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Action is prov'd by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and viſible Effects, as that</hi> Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am <hi>of</hi> Normandy <hi>Conquer'd</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>while there are ſo many Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of that Conqueſt in our Laws and Cuſtoms:</hi> And what may be prov'd by more viſible and continu'd Effects than the Superiority of Biſhops over Presbyters? The Laws and Cuſtoms of all Churches are full of this; all the Chriſtian World being govern'd by Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Epiſcopacy till the laſt Age; and yet notwithſtanding theſe viſible effects,
<pb facs="tcp:64435:5"/>we muſt not believe this Government to be Apoſtolical, when the Ancient Hiſtory that delivers it as ſuch is prov'd by ſuch <hi>Continu'd viſible Effects.</hi> Here we are in a great Streight again, which to truſt, the <hi>Critic</hi> or the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6. That Hiſtory is credible which ſpeaketh conſentingly againſt the known Intereſt of the Author.</hi> Well, but many of Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Characters of Ancient Biſhops, are taken from profeſs'd Enemies, or perſons manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prejudic'd, as his Accounts of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius, Theophilus, Cyril,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others do manifeſtly ſhew: But here he does endeavour to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſays, <hi>What I ſay of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of Biſhops and Councils is moſt in their own Words:</hi> Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are not the Words of the Biſhops or Councils, but Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Own, when he miſtakes in Tranſlating them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What I ſay againſt Popes, is but the Recital of what is ſaid by the Greateſt Defenders and Flatterers of Popes:</hi> And let thoſe Flatterers
<pb facs="tcp:64435:5"/>and Defenders anſwer him if they think it worth their while; but becauſe upon this occaſion he is pleas'd to give Account of his Authors, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Authorities. He tells us in the firſt place, who he has not made uſe of: <hi>I give you not a word</hi> (ſays he) out of <hi>Luther,</hi> nor <hi>Illyricus,</hi> nor the <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> &amp;c. It is no great Matter: For they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſaffected to Popery, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may be liable to Exceptions: But it is ſomething hard to reject thoſe that follow. <hi>No nor out of the Collections of</hi> Goldaſtus, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quardus, Freherus, Rubrus, Piſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So familiar to him, that <hi>Marquardus Freherus</hi> makes two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors by the ſame Figure that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Tullius Cicero</hi> makes three: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs you will lay this Miſtake up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Printer; but then you cannot eaſily give a reaſon, why, in the midſt of ſo many Surnames, <hi>Freherus</hi> ſhould have his Chriſtian Name more than any of the reſt: But whoever this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake belongs to, it is plain, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had but little Acquaintance with
<pb facs="tcp:64435:6"/>thoſe Collections. He tells us, <hi>He gives us not a Word out of them.</hi> It muſt be ſurely great Modeſty to conceal his Authors, or his Ignorance not to know them: For he does really gives us ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things from theſe Collections, and cites his Authors too. <hi>Egriſthart</hi> and the<note n="*" place="margin">Call'd by <hi>Aimon,</hi> l. 4. c. <hi>ult.

It is a ſtrange thing, that a Man who talks ſo much of leaving the World, ſhould not yet have left the Vanity of pretending, and of muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Books of which he had never ſeen any more than the Titles.</p>
            <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> gives Account of his Authors <hi>negatively;</hi> in the

            <p>
               <hi>The Subſtance of the Common Hiſtory</hi> (the Rarities are not to be enquired after whence they come) <hi>is taken out of the commonly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Church Hiſtorians,</hi> and among them Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does reckon <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> the firſt time doubtleſs that ever he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd among the <hi>Commonly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church Hiſtorians:</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> names <hi>Euſebius, Socrates,</hi> and ſome others; but I am afraid Mr. <hi>B.</hi> miſtakes Dr. <hi>Hanmar</hi>'s Tranſlation for <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation which <hi>Mr. B.</hi> makes uſe of, has ſeldom the Sence of the Authors, and oftentimes none at all. The main part of the Councils he owns to be taken out of <hi>Binius,</hi> of an Old incorrect E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Year <hi>1606.</hi> but it muſt be noted, that where <hi>Mr. B.</hi> did not underſtand <hi>Binius,</hi> he is pleas'd to give ſomething of his own.</p>

               <hi>7. The next Degree of Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility depends upon the Veracity, or Credible Fitneſs of the Reporter,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64435:7"/>as, <hi>1. One that liv'd upon the place, or near. 2. A Wiſe Man. 3. One that made it his long and hard Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. 4.

And after this, he tells us of ſeveral ſorts of Men that are not to be believ'd: among others, <hi>One that is deeply engag'd in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; One that ſhews a Malignant Spirit, that extenuateth or denieth (he might have added concealeth) all the Good that was in his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and faſtens on them all the Odium that he can, without juſt Proof,</hi> mutato nomine de te; <hi>One that is ignorant or proud; a ſilly, weak Man; nor one that is paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately raſh,</hi> with many more things to this purpoſe. And how well the Circumſtances of Credibility agree with his Hiſtory, or how little theſe diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting Circumſtances concern him, the Reader will beſt judge: <hi>How Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, how Calm, how diſingag'd from Faction, how well vers'd in this Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64435:7"/>As for his Temper, the Books he lately Publiſh'd ſufficiently diſcover it; and let the Reader judge, whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Man rail'd with greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, or leſs Provocation? Now to give ſome Inſtances of his Chriſtian Meekneſs, <hi>pag. 19.</hi> he calls the preſent Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England, A few Turbulent Prelates, p. 46. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing, deſtroying Prelates. p. 73. Proud, Contentious, Ambitious, Hereticating part of the Biſhops. p. 50.

Self-conceited Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. p. 196. Mercileſs, Furious Biſhops. p. 183. The Confounders of Churches,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>But Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Tranſlation of Canon the 21ſt. of the Council of <hi>Tours</hi> is ſomething more conſiderable, becauſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes Remarks upon it, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of ſome Diſſenters: The Paſſage is ſomthing long, but to make the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der amends, it ſhall be the laſt; not for want of Matter, but becauſe I would not tire him with too many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of one ſort: the foreſaid Canon is thus rendred by Mr. <hi>B. p. 187. Thoſe that the Law commandeth to be put to Death, if they deſire to hear the Preacher, we will have to be convicted unto life</hi> (i.e. <hi>not to die;</hi>) <hi>for they are to be ſlain with the Sword of the Mouth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of Communion, if they will not obſerve the decrees of the Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors left them, and do deſpiſe to hear the Paſtor, and will not be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.

The matter in ſhort is thus:
<pb facs="tcp:64435:11"/>This Canon ſpeaks of ſuch as having vowed Virginity, do afterwards mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and that tho' the Eccleſiaſtical Laws do puniſh ſuch with perpetual Excommunication; yet this Council thought fit ſo far to mitigate the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as to offer Pennance and Reconciliation to ſuch who ſhall ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from theſe Marriages; which the Council expreſſes thus: <hi>Nos vero ſi quos lex perimi jubet, ſi cupiunt audire praeconem volumus ut con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertantur ad vitam: Nam peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendi ſunt Oris Gladio, &amp; Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nione privandi, ſi relicta ſibi Senio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum decreta obſervare noluerint, &amp; paſtorem ſuum audire deſpexerint, &amp; eſſe ſeparati noluerint, i. e.</hi> 
               <q>We or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that thoſe whom the Rigor of the eccleſiaſtical law commands to be cut off, if they deſire to hear the voice of the Preacher, (calling them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) ſhould be converted and live: For thoſe that refuſe to obey the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Biſhops that have been before us, and alſo neglect their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and will not ſeperate themſelves, (<hi>i. e.</hi> from thoſe unlawful Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges)
<pb facs="tcp:64435:11"/>are to be cut off by the Sword of the Mouth, and Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> And this is explained by what follows preſently after, <hi>Qui verò in hac pertinacia perdurare voluerint, &amp; potius in volutabro malae Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſationis permanere quam ſe de veti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Conjugio ſeparare perenni Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicatione damnentur, i. e.</hi> Let thoſe who will obſtinately perſiſt, and chuſe rather to wallow in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a forbidden Marriage, than to ſeperate from it, be condemn'd to perpetual Excommunication.

               <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes a wonderful Diſcovery, that <hi>in the Canon they put a Book called,</hi> ORDO HISTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIAR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M: And now let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> value it ſelf if it dare, for having preſerv'd the Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture entire and undiminiſh'd; ſince Mr. <hi>B.</hi> plainly diſcovers a Book to have been once in their Canon, which is not now to be found in any of the Pope's Bibles. A ſtrange thing this! that no body ſhould ever diſcover this before: But I wonder that he did not find out another Book in that Canon, every whit as ſtrange as this, and that is <hi>Ordo Prophetarum:</hi> For there it is as a General Title before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as this <hi>Ordo Hiſtoriarum</hi> is before ſome Hiſtorical Books. This miſtake is as if a Man ſhould find a Chapter in the Bible call'd <hi>Contents,</hi> or a Book call'd <hi>Apocrypha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have given theſe few Inſtances, out of many of Mr. <hi>B's</hi> great Abilities in Church-Hiſtory, that the Reader may perceive how much this Infamous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt Biſhops and Councils is to be depended upon; and let any Man
<pb facs="tcp:64435:15"/>that has any acquaintance with theſe Mattters, judge impartially whether this Hiſtory do really diſgrace Biſhops or Councils, or any body elſe ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually as it does the Author? And if this be the Effect of <hi>having made Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory ones long and hard Study,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven let us burn <hi>Binius</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> and go make Buttons: We may with honeſt Application employ our time ſo to much better purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I muſt detain the Reader a little longer with this Preface, while I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to clear ſome Paſſages of this Book, which may ſeem to be anſwered already, the Effect of them being ſaid in behalf of Epiſcopacy, and replied to on the part of the Diſſenters: For ſome part of this Book being Printed <hi>8</hi> or <hi>9</hi> Months ago, and the Subject having been treated by ſeveral Hands, it could not be, but that ſeveral things ſhould be ſaid to the ſame effect in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. <hi>B's</hi> Allegations for the Congregational Way; and in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, with what is written here; and being repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to there, ſeem already to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb facs="tcp:64435:15"/>their Anſwer: Wherefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it neceſſary to take off ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions as prevented any Paſſages in this Book; and becauſe it could not be done conveniently, in the Book it ſelf, to reſerve them for the Preface: But upon Examination, I found them to be fewer than I did at firſt imagine; For Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> ſince his Church-Hiſtory, <hi>and Treatiſe of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> has made no farther Impreſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Controverſie; I have examin'd ſome Chapters of that Book that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd the Deſign of this Hiſtory, by the Addition of ſeveral Hiſtorical Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to diſgrace the Epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the occaſion of all Miſchiefs in the Church: As for the firſt part, about the Order of Biſhops, it had too many particulars to be minutely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; but the Subſtance of it having been ſaid in ſhort in the firſt Chapter of his Church, and more at large in his Diſputation of Church Government, has been examin'd in the beginning of this Book Dr. <hi>O.</hi> hath follow'd Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in the Congregational way; and as for his Allegations out of Antiquity, they are
<pb facs="tcp:64435:16"/>tranſcribed out of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> with little of Improvement or Addition. One would think a diligent Man might find good Gleaning after Mr. <hi>B.</hi> but Dr. <hi>O's.</hi> Book, it ſeems, is anſwered already by an unknown Hand: But there is a later Book publiſhed under the Title of <hi>No Evidence for Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Churches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the Primitive Times, in Anſwer to the Dean of St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Allegations out of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity for ſuch Churches,</hi> &amp;c. But no Reply being yet made, that I know of to thoſe Exceptions, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to take off ſuch of them as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern me.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> I have endeavored to prove, that the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Time, was Dioceſan; and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, urge for it the Multitude of Presbyters that belong'd to that Church, even in the time of Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the greateſt part of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy was fallen off. The Author above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned excepts againſt this, where it is alleadg'd by the Dean of <hi>S. Paul's,</hi> and offers two things in Anſwer; <hi>1.</hi> A Paſſage out of Biſhop <hi>Downham, That
<pb facs="tcp:64435:16"/>indeed, at the firſt Converſions of Cities, the whole Number of the People converted (being ſometimes not much greater than the Number of Preſbyters plac'd among them) were able to make but a ſmall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation:</hi> But this Allegation can be of little <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, becauſe, <hi>1.</hi> This was not the Caſe of the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> it was not a new converted Church, but ſettled long before, and in a flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Condition. <hi>2.</hi> Many more Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters may be ordain'd in a City than is neceſſary for the firſt Beginnings of a Church, with reſpect to future En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; and for the Service of ſuch as afterwards ſhould believe: So that tho' there might be in a new gather'd Church, almoſt as many Presbyters as there are People, yet the Deſign of that number of Officers may be for ſeveral Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, when the Believers of that place ſhould become ſo numerous as not to be contain'd in one. <hi>3.</hi> The Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Presbyters belonging to one Congregational Church, might be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the uncertain Abode of moſt of the Apoſtles and their Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb facs="tcp:64435:17"/>who are the Principal, if not the only Ordainers of Presbyters, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture. Therefore they might ordain more than were juſt neceſſary for the preſent Occaſions of a Church, becauſe they could not be preſent to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, as often as the Increaſe of a Church, or Vacancies, or other Neceſſities of it ſhould require. But that any Church fix'd and ſettled, having its Biſhop always preſent, ſhould multiply Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters beyond Neceſſity, in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible: For the neceſſary Expences of the Church were very great; the Poor numerous; the generality of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians not of the Richeſt; and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates they had being at the Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Enemies, and ruin'd with perpetual Perſecution: Is it credible, that perſons in this Condition would multiply Officers without Neceſſity, who were to be maintain'd out of the Public Stock; as <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirms the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of <hi>Carthage</hi> were? And laſtly, if this Opinion of Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi> had any certain Ground in Antiquity,
<pb facs="tcp:64435:17"/>We ſhould probably hear of it with both Ears: and we ſhould have it recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended upon Ancienter Authority than His: But the firſt which this Author cites is <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> who complains of the Multitude of <hi>Preſbyters</hi> in his Time: This has been already alleadg'd by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and has received An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and he that cannot anſwer it to himſelf from the great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Condition of the Church in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and in <hi>Nazianzen</hi>'s Time, has a fondneſs for the Argument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my Skill to remove.</p>
            <p>The next Inſtance of the number of Presbyters belonging to the great Church of <hi>C. P.</hi> St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the World, will do as little Service, as the complaint of <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen: Juſtinian</hi> (ſays that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) <hi>Obſerving that Officers in Churches were multiply'd beyond reaſon and meaſure, takes order that they ſhould be reduc'd to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the firſt Eſtabliſhment; but in the great Church at C. P. he would have the Preſbyters brought down to Sixty:</hi> And what follows
<pb facs="tcp:64435:18"/>from this? That the Number of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters was become extravagant in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian</hi>'s Time; but what is this to their Number in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s: For this very Edict of <hi>Juſtinian ſhews,</hi> that this multiplying of Church-Officers, was an Innovation, and therefore would have them reduc'd to the firſt Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but that firſt Eſtabliſhment it ſeems admitted great Numbers; for one Church had Sixty: True; but it muſt alſo be noted firſt, that theſe ſixty were to ſerve more than one Church: For there were three more, beſides St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> to be ſupply'd by thoſe Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as may be ſeen in the Conſtitution, <hi>Nov. 3. c. 1. viz.</hi> St. <hi>Mary's</hi> Church, and that of <hi>Theodorus</hi> the Martyr, and that of <hi>Helena,</hi> as ſome, but of <hi>Irene</hi> as others read: Yet after all, there is no Argument to be drawn from this Number; for theſe were Canons of a particular Foundation, deſign'd for the Service of a Collegiate Church, and no meaſure to be taken from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Numbers of Presbyters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Dioceſs. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Preface of the ſaid <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64435:18"/>whither I refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>But I muſt confeſs, that what this Gentleman adds concerning the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is ſomething ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing. <hi>No doubt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they</hi> (the Presbyters) <hi>were more numerous in</hi> C.

            <p>But notwithſtanding the Number of Chriſtians in <hi>C. P.</hi> might be much too great for one Congregation, yet the major part might be Hereticks, or Schiſmaticks, ſuch as came not to the Biſhops Church,
<pb facs="tcp:64435:21"/>and therefore <hi>all</hi> that adher'd to him, might be no more than could meet in one Aſſembly. To which I anſwer, towards the latter end of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's</hi> Reign, it was ſo far from being the Caſe of the Church, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks was inconſiderable; and moſt of thoſe were forc'd to come to Church; and that there may be no Difficulty remaining in this point, I will give ſome farther account of the number of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Chriſtians in compariſon with Hereticks and Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> having ſet his Heart upon Chriſtian Religion, to ſettle and adorn it, he thought nothing more effectual than the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of Chriſtians; to promote which, he reſolv'd to proceed againſt all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Diſſenters by a ſevere Law, and to reduce them to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church.

<pb facs="tcp:64435:23"/>To conclude this point then, <hi>Theodoret</hi> could not think that all the Believers of <hi>C.

            <p>It would ſwell this Preface to too
<pb facs="tcp:64435:23"/>great a Bulk; if I ſhould anſwer the reſt ſo particularly: Therefore I ſhall be more brief, but as plain as I can; <hi>p. 10, 11, 12.</hi> This Author gives ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Inſtances of ſeveral Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one City at the ſame time, in Anſwer to the Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, <hi>That it was an inviolable Rule of the Church, to have but one.</hi> I have endeavored to ſhew, that it was the <hi>Rule</hi> of the Church to have no more than one: So <hi>Cornelius</hi> affirms, that in a Catholick Church there ought to be no more; and the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> finds Expedients even againſt the ſhew and appearance of two Biſhops being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one place. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is the firſt Inſtance, which is ſaid to have had ſeveral Biſhops together in the time of <hi>Narciſſus.</hi> I wonder to find a man of Learning cite this Paſſage, than which nothing can be more diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to his Cauſe: For <hi>1.

               <hi>till</hi> Cyril<hi>'s time.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as briefly as I can. <hi>1.</hi> That <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> cannot mean that all other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had had two Biſhops at a time: For the contrary is too notorious, and the Caſes above alleadg'd are extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, when the Biſhop, or People of a City had a mind to ſecure the next Succeſſion to ſome Extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<pb facs="tcp:64435:25"/>He was made the Aſſiſtant and Coajutor of that Biſhop he was to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: If <hi>Alexandria</hi> had never done this (and it might be the reaſon why <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was not ordained then when he was deſign'd by <hi>Alexander</hi>) I do not ſee what advantage can be made of this Paſſage; the practice of thoſe other Churches has been already conſidered: However I do not ſee why that <hi>Learned Antiquary's</hi> Opinion may not be maintain'd againſt this Gent's. Objections: He ſays, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> was divided before <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> his Time, between ſeveral Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: It cannot be denied; but that is not the thing <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſpeaks of, but that before the Election of <hi>Theonas</hi> againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who was before appointed by <hi>Alexander</hi> with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Church, there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver two oppoſite Biſhops, as in other Churches: the Inſtances are all later than this Fact; and therefore are inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs it be that of the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. That they had their Biſhops ſucceſſively</hi> to <hi>Cyril's</hi> Time:<note place="margin">Soc. l. 7. c. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> does not ſay in the place alleadg'd;
<pb facs="tcp:64435:26"/>but only that <hi>Cyril</hi> had taken from him all that he had; and <hi>Succeſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> from what time had they their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops there? That is not ſaid: It may be they began there after this time: For there is little account in Church-Hiſtory, that I know, of any <hi>Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in <hi>Alexandria</hi> before <hi>Athanaſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Inſtance is pregnant, <hi>and compriſing many at once,</hi> as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman tells us, it is that of <hi>Valerius</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who were Biſhops of <hi>Hippo</hi> together; and <hi>the Biſhops of thoſe Parts aſſured</hi> Auſtin, <hi>that this was uſual, and prov'd it by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, both in the</hi> Africane <hi>and</hi> Tranſmarine <hi>Churches,</hi> as <hi>Poſſedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> tells us: But ſuppoſe all this true, that this might be maintain'd by the Examples of ſeveral Churches: What is it? That two Biſhops may be in one Church? No, that is not the Matter; but that a Biſhop, when he grows Old, may appoint or ordain his Succeſſor, to prevent the Miſchiefs that are uſually produc'd by popular Elections, and to ſecure the Succeſſion to ſome Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Man; and this was not thought
<pb facs="tcp:64435:26"/>to violate that Rule that allow'd but one Biſhop to a City: For this Proviſion for a Succeſſor does not deſtroy that Rule. For Inſtance, I believe no man will deny, but that this Government is Monarchical in its Conſtitution; and that it, ought to be in the hands of a Single Perſon; or if Royalliſts, word be not Authority enough, the Worthy Gentlemen that would have convinc'd <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Conſcience about is, I hope will ſatisfie: And yet, after that this Succeſſion had been a little interrupted by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation of King <hi>Stephen, Henry</hi> the Second thought it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make his Eldeſt Son King in his Life Time, and to have him Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſecure the Succeſſion: Yet for all this, and tho ſome more Inſtances may be fetch'd of the ſame Nature, from neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Kingdoms, yet I belive it will be true enough, that it is the Rule of theſe ſeveral Kingdoms to have but one King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this, as far as I am able to perceive, is the utmoſt that can be made of all thoſe Inſtances of two Biſhops in one Church. As for the laſt Reaſon of the Rule about dividing the
<pb facs="tcp:64435:27"/>Revenue, I ſuppoſe it is added only out of Gayety, and might have been left to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who is us'd to ſupply his Want of Learning with a double Portion of Spight. But I have too much reſpect for this Perſon (who ſhews more Learning than any of the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for Diſſenters) to make any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Rule</hi> is likewiſe <hi>pag. 15.</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn'd by Exceptions from the <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> at <hi>Carthage;</hi> but of this I have ſpoke ſo particlarly in the following Book, that I think it unncceſſary to add any more.</p>
            <p>The next thing I find concerns any thing alleadg'd by me is <hi>p. 23.</hi> where the Biſhoprick of <hi>Hippo</hi> is conſider'd. I have ſhew'd the Names of a good number of Pariſhes in it, which were under the Care of their Presbyters, and among others alleadg'd the <hi>Town</hi> of <hi>Fuſſala;</hi> the Gentleman Tranſlates it a <hi>Caſtle,</hi> I ſuppoſe to diminiſh it; but theſe Caſtles were Garriſon-Towns, with a good dependance of Villages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them; and this particularly is ſo repreſented. It was Forty miles
<pb facs="tcp:64435:27"/>from <hi>Hippo,</hi> and was in St. <hi>Auſtin's Dioceſs,</hi> and never had a Biſhop of its own. This the Gentleman anſwers, by ſaying, <hi>That the reaſon why it had a Biſhop no ſooner, is ſignify'd by St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> when he ſaith there were no Catholicks at all in it:</hi> St <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays indeed, the Town or Caſtle it ſelf had none, but the County belonging to it had ſome: <hi>Paucos ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebat illa Terra Catholicos:</hi> And there were ſeveral Presbyters belonging to thoſe Catholicks, <hi>Preſbyteri qui eis Congregandis à nobis primitùs ſunt Conſtituti:</hi> But I believe the reaſon alleadg'd for their having a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop no ſooner will hardly hold: For firſt, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, that this Town, when he ſet upon the Reduction of it, to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church, had <hi>then</hi> no Catholicks; but that it never had any he does not ſay; nor is the thing probable: But as for a Biſhop, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſays, that it never had any; but that it formerly had Catholicks, we may conclude by Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, becauſe it belong'd heretofore to the Dioceſs of <hi>Hippo. Simul cum
<pb facs="tcp:64435:28"/>contigua ſibi regione ad paroeciam Hipponenſis Eccleſiae pertinuit.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would ask what did belong to the Biſhop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> the Stones or the Timber of the Town, ſince none of the People did ever own him: Nor can it be imagin'd how a Town ſo diſtant ſhould be judg'd to belong to that Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe, where yet there never was one Man that own'd the Juriſdiction: So that I conceive this reaſon will not hold for its having no Biſhop of its own, ſince the ſame reaſon deſtroys its dependance upon the Dioceſe of <hi>Hippo,</hi> which is exprefly affirm'd. As to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Excuſe, that it was too far, and that he could not look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the inconſiderable Reliques of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> there: It is to be aſcrib'd to his Modeſty, ſince he diſcharg'd the Office of a Biſhop towards it in much more difficult Times, while the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters he employ'd were barbarouſly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the generality of the People were againſt him.</p>
            <p>The Towns in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Dioceſe, mention'd by the <hi>D.</hi> of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> this <hi>Gentleman</hi> finds to have had B ſhops
<pb facs="tcp:64435:28"/>of their own or ſome other Towns that had Names like them, which yet may not be the ſame; but here I am uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, having, as I remember, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd none of theſe places, but divers others: But I cannot paſs by what he offers <hi>p. 26.</hi> That St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Epiſcopalem Sarcinam Hipponen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem,</hi> the <hi>Epiſcopal Charge of</hi> Hippo, as if he had been Biſhop of the Town only: Nay, but of part of that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> had their Biſhop there too. This will ſtrangely diminiſh the Biſhoprick of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which at firſt appear'd ſo large. To which I anſwer, That for the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> having a Biſhop there it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies little to our preſent purpoſe, ſince he was but an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper, and the whole Dioceſs did of right belong to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Biſhop: As to the Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was only Biſhop of the Town let us believe himſelf: <hi>Hoc Eccleſiae Catholicae, aut ut modum diſpenſationis meae non ſupergre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diar,<note place="margin">Ep. 159.</note> hoc Eccleſiae ad</hi> Hipponenſium <hi>Regionem pertinenti prodeſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtor:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64435:29"/>Which plainly ſignifies, that all the Church, belonging not only to the <hi>Town,</hi> but alſo to the <hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Hippo,</hi> belong'd to him. There is but one thing more which I ſhall obſerve concerning the Dicceſs of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po;</hi> and that is a Paſſage cited out of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep. 68.</note> to ſhew, that there were many Biſhops in that <hi>Region. Ecce interim Epiſcopos noſtros qui ſunt in Regione</hi> Hipponenſi, <hi>ubi a veſtris tanta mala patimur convenire.</hi> To which I anſwer, that theſe Biſhops, who are ſaid to be <hi>in Regione</hi> Hipponenſi, were not the Biſhops of that Region, but ſome Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the Province met together there; as had been done before upon the like Occaſion, as may be ſeen in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>Facto Concilio placuit ut conveniremini. 2,</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Inſcription and Stile of this Epiſtle, <hi>Clerici Catholici Regionis</hi> Hipponenſium; and yet ſpeaking of the Biſhop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> they call him their Biſhop, not one of their Biſhops, which they muſt have
<pb facs="tcp:64435:29"/>ſaid if they had had more; but <hi>Conventus ab Epiſcopo noſtro Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culeianus, —non eſt Conqueſtus Epiſcopus noſter, &amp;c.</hi> So that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe Biſhops mention'd in the Region of <hi>Hippo,</hi> the Body of that Clergy own but one who was properly their Dioceſan: And this is farther clear'd by comparing this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage with that of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little before, where he aſſumes to himſelf the Church belonging to the <hi>Regio Hipponenſium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Dioceſs of <hi>Hippo,</hi> we paſs to that of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of which I have ſpoke particularly enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but here the ſame Author of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a great many things, <hi>p. 32.</hi> which I cannot anſwer at this time ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particularly; yet ſomething I ſhall ſay as briefly as I can. The Inſtance of <hi>Maraeotis,</hi> he ſays little to; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates as if <hi>Maraeotis</hi> might not have Number enough of Chriſtians to have a Biſhop. But this <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> does ſufficiently ſhew to be a Groundleſs Conjecture; and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:64435:30"/>
               <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> the Generality of the People there were Chriſtians. He farther finds one <hi>Dracontius</hi> made a Biſhop in the Territory of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria;</hi> poſſibly a <hi>Chorepiſcopus,</hi> or at leaſt-wiſe, it is manifeſt from the Epiſtle to him, that it was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Favor of the People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, that compell'd him to accept a Biſhoprick: And the Danger of their falling to <hi>Arrianiſm</hi> was the reaſon which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> makes uſe of to preſs him to accept it. This was an extraordinary Caſe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this man a Country Biſhoprick, that of <hi>Alexandria</hi> would be a great deal to big for the Congregational Meaſure. After this we have Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſeveral Cities that had Biſhops, and lay very near one the other; and what does this conclude? Might not theſe Dioceſes be yet much larger than one Congregation? Suppoſe the Chief Cities of <hi>Holland</hi> had each a Biſhop, yet I conceive they would be Dioceſans, though thoſe Cities lie ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cloſe together. And now after all
<pb facs="tcp:64435:30"/>this, though we have ſeveral Inſtances out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> how near Cities were together in ſome parts; yet upon the whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Ath. Ap. 2.</note> the Dioceſes do appear to be large enough from the Number of them: For in <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> his Time, there were not a Hundred Biſhops in all <hi>Egypt, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, is the Defence of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Allegation out of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> to ſhew, that all the Chriſtians of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> could meet in one Church. It is to be confeſs'd, that the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of that Father do ſeem to favor him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, hold <hi>all,</hi> &amp;c. Now ſuppoſe that all the Chriſtians in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks at leaſt-wiſe, could meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that Great Church, yet all the Dioceſs could not; there were ſome parts of it at a good Diſtance, and they could not conveniently come;
<pb facs="tcp:64435:31"/>ſo that the Dioceſs of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> will exceed the meaſure of the Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Way. <hi>2.</hi> Suppoſe this Great Church could receive all the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, yet if that Multitude was too great for Perſonal Communion, it is inſignificant: For if that be a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Church that can poſſibly meet between the ſame Walls, this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church will be as indefinite as a Dioceſs. <hi>3.</hi> Before this the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> met in diſtinct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: But we are told, that theſe places were very <hi>ſmall, ſhort, and ſtreight places:</hi> So I ſuppoſe they were in reſpect of the Multitude of Chriſtians which they did ſcarcely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. But that they were ſuch <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> as ſome of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in <hi>England</hi> have as great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as <hi>Alexandria,</hi> is hardly credible; becauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> The Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was very numerous from the beginning; and if they met all in one place, it muſt conſequently be very large: Nor
<pb facs="tcp:64435:31"/>is it likely they ſhould divide till they were grown too numerous for the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Meeting-place they could conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently have.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Tho' before the Empire was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they might be confin'd to little pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and forc'd to meet ſeverally, yet after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> became Chriſtian, it is not likely that the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> would content themſelves with <hi>ſmall and ſtreight Chappels,</hi> when every ordinary City built very Great and Magnificent Cathedrals; And,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Some of theſe Churches had been built with a Deſign of receiving as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as well could have Perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Worſhip together; as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> is ſaid by <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> to have built a Church bigger than any of thoſe they had before: And yet this and all the reſt were but few, and ſtreight, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the great Multitude of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks that were in <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I conceive after all this, that the Expreſſions of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> do not conclude, that all the Chriſtians in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> were met in that Great
<pb facs="tcp:64435:32"/>Church: All that came, it may be found Room; but that all did come is not eaſily imagin'd: For the Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous manner in which they come to their Biſhop, to demand a General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, makes it probable, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Women and Children would be glad to abſent themſelves, but many more, either apprehenſive of the Effect of this Tumultuous Proceeding, or of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuch a Crowd, would willingly ſtay away. Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> tho' he thought the main Body of the Catholicks might meet here, yet he would not conclude that all did; and even theſe that did aſſemble here, were too many for one Congregation; and was an Aſſembly more for ſolemnity and oſtentation, than for Perſonal Communion in Worſhip, and the proper Ends of a Religious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>
            <p>But that we may not wonder how the Catholicks ſhould be ſo few in <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> his Time, we are told farther, that the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and other Diſsenters might make much the <hi>Major</hi> part: <hi>Nay, it may be the</hi> Arrians <hi>alone were
<pb facs="tcp:64435:32"/>more numerous.</hi> How true this is, we may learn from <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Catholick Party, makes them the <hi>Major</hi> part of the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: All theſe were Catholicks, and their buſineſs was to deſire <hi>Siria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> not to diſturb their Churches, till they might ſend to the Emperor. And that they were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part, might be yet farther clear'd from ſeveral Circumſtances of that time, which I cannot inſiſt upon in this place, without being too tedious to the Reader. To conclude this, not only <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the other Cities of <hi>Egypt</hi> had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Congregations compriz'd in the ſame Dioceſs, but the <hi>Meletians</hi> had ſome Biſhops of ſeveral Titles who had more Cities than one in their Dioceſſes, as may be ſeen in the Catalogue of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, ordain'd by <hi>Meletius,</hi> and given in to the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſtthing I ſhall take notice of, is the Dioceſe of <hi>Theodoret.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I juſt mention'd and remitted, the Reader to the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Pauls,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:64435:33"/>had ſpoke very particularly of it: I ſhall therefore ſay very little to it here, being unwilling to do any prejudice to ſo good a Cauſe, and ſo great a Perſon, by a weak and unneceſſary Defence: But this I cannot omit, that if thoſe <hi>800,</hi> not <hi>80</hi> Churches, as this Gentleman reckons them, belong'd to him as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan, and they were all Epiſcopal, this poor Region of <hi>Cyrus</hi> would have more Biſhops than all <hi>Africk,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were more numerous there, than in any part of the World beſides.</p>
            <p>I have no more to add, but that there was deſign'd a Chapter concerning the Right of electing Biſhops and Church-Officers, with an Hiſtorical Deduction of the Practice of the Church, through the ſeveral Ages of it; but becauſe it could not anſwer the Deſign firſt form'd without ſwelling this Book to too great a Bulk: It may hereafter in due time be publiſh'd by it ſelf: The Subject af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording Variety enough for a large Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and requiring ſome Time and Diligence to do it to any Effect.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Deſign of Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Church Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and his Notion of Primitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Epiſcopacy.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THERE is nothing ſo fatal to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, as our unhappy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions about it, eſpecially ſuch as divide the Church into Parties, abhorring each others Communion: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, the very Diſagreement between men of the ſame Profeſſion, brings the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine under ſuſpition of Falſhood or Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; the Method that the Parties contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, commonly make uſe of to ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by the Diſparagement and Reproach of the contrary ſide, ſerves to bring them and their Religion into the loweſt Contempt: and the Reſult of all is, that the common Enemy is made Judge between them, who fairly ſums up the Evidence, and paſſes Sentence upon all ſides, according to their mutual Accuſation.</p>
               <p>This ſad Truth is but too much confirmed, by the experience of our times, wherein there are few ſo happily removed from the noiſe of profane Converſation, as not frequently to hear the ſcurrilous Blaſphemies of the Atheiſt, under pretence of running down the ſeveral Factions in Religion; 'tis this gives them Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64435:36"/>and Protection, and while they pretend to expoſe this or that Party, they have the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, with little change of Company, to mock all Religion by parcels, and that with the great good likeing and approbation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians themſelves.</p>
               <p>This is no ſuch News, but that moſt men ſeem to be ſenſible of it, and bewail the thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Prophaneneſs, by the Countenance that it receives from our Differences; yet for all this, how few abate any thing of their Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? How few will be ſo moderate as to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice even the moſt diſingenious Arts of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Calumny,</hi> and <hi>Railing,</hi> to the Safety and Honour of our common Faith.</p>
               <p>I wiſh Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had had this Conſideration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him when he ſet upon the writing of his <hi>Church Hiſtory of Biſhops, and their Councils abridged,</hi> he has indeed ſufficiently <hi>abridg'd</hi> all the good Services that Biſhops and Councils have done to the Church, but their Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he has enlarg'd upon to purpoſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, by a foul Juggle, conveyed the beſt of their Actions into the Catalogue of their Crimes, and their greateſt Services for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, prove a conſiderable part of their Endict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I muſt confeſs, I never ſaw any thing that in my Judgment reflected with more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour upon Religion, than this ſtrange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that he has given of the progreſs of it, and the frightful Repreſentation that he has made of the Church in all Ages; Heathens have been civil and modeſt in their Character of us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>l.</hi> 27.</note> compar'd with this. <hi>Ammianus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64435:36"/>though he be ſomething ſharp upon <hi>Damaſus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet ſpeaks honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the generality of Chriſtian Biſhops; <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus</hi> does not mention <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> with any diſreſpct,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 23.</note> though he had a fair occaſion; nay the ſcurril Wit of that Buffoon <hi>Lucian,</hi> nor the Malice of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, have left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing half ſo ſcandalous in all their Libels againſt Chriſtians, as this Church Hiſtorian has raked up; for here is nothing to be ſeen in his Book, but the Avarice, Ambition, Ignorance, Miſtakes, and furious Contentions of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and the Governours of the Church. And they being ſo bad, the People that were guided by their Order and Example, could not be much better, they were but the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Epiſcopal Ambition, to fight their Quarrels, to kill all that oppoſed, and to burn and deſtroy all that came before them; turbulent, ſeditious, Incendiaries and Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and what can be the effect of ſuch an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, but that men ſhould believe there never was any ſort of People ſo deſperately wicked, and ſo great diſturbers of the World: the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of our Religion will have reaſon to rejoyce, that his work is in great meaſure done to his hands, for this will ſerve him as a common place book, for railing againſt Chriſtianity, and the Chriſtian Reader will be in danger, either of looſing all his Patience, or a great deal of that Reverence he had for his Religion, and thoſe primitive Worthies that profeſt and defended it.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64435:37"/>
               <p>But this perhaps will be thought not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Church, but the Biſhops only, who are charged with theſe Miſdemeanours, and diſhonour'd by this Repreſentation. He muſt have a ſtrange notion of the Church, that can think it unconcerned in the diſhonour of thoſe by whom it is governed: for if one ſhould write a Book, and call it the Hiſtory of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, which ſhould only repreſent the Vices of our Kings, the Contentions and Diſagreements of our Parliaments, the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Corruption of our Miniſters of State and Juſtice, and repreſent all perſons that were eminent enough to hold any place in Story, under mean and infamous Characters; he muſt needs have a very metaphyſical Moderation,, that could think the honour of the Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned, and that it was no Reflection upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> name.</p>
               <p>God forbid I ſhould charge the Deſign of the Author with any diſſervice to Religion; but well-meaning men do ſometimes purſue their Reſentments too far, and ſo they can be revenged of their Enemies, purſue them into the Church, and ſet upon them in the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not conſidering how much it is violated and profaned by the Action. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is not inſenſible of the evil uſe that may be made of this book, and therefore endeavours to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it by wholſome Caution, and frequently in his Hiſtory ſtarting like a man affrighted to ſee that which he though to have been a Rod turn'd into a Serpent, ſtreight applies what Remedies he can againſt the Poyſon: he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64435:37"/>does in the firſt place warm the Reader, that he do not abuſe this into <hi>Diaboliſme.</hi> But alas it is a poor Relief, to forbid an Enemy to make uſe of thoſe Weapons you have put into his hands, to leave the Honour of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at his Mercy, and then to deſire him to be generous, not to make uſe of his Advantage. However, if the Scorner ſhould prove perverſe and take no Warning, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> proceeds to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute his reaſoning, and his Inference, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this ſcandalous account of the Biſhops and their Councils, concludes nothing to the diſcredit of Church or Religion; for there were many good men that were not Biſhops but Presbyters, Monks, or Lay-men; nay,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 16. 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> many He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; obſcure good men, whoſe Vertues do not ſhine in Story; nay, there were ſome good men among the Biſhops themſelves, with more to the effect. God forbid I ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to invalidate the leaſt ſhadow of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, that is urg'd in defence of the Church of Chriſt; I joyn heartily with him in this part, and I muſt profeſs, it is the greateſt end of this Treatiſe, to prevent the Contempt of Religion, which this Church Hiſtory might occaſion. Nor can I think the Author will be offended, that I take his part and Religions againſt his own Book, and that I look upon it as a dangerous piece,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 16. 19. § 49.22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> when he himſelf has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuch frequent and ſolemn Warnings againſt it.</p>
               <p>But I muſt take leave to purſue this point up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another Suppoſition than he does, for he takes all his Hiſtory to be a true and juſt repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64435:38"/>of things, and upon that ſuppoſal, makes his Vindication of the Church; which I hope is a miſtake in him, and will endeavour to ſhew, is very far from being true; nay on the contrary, it is the moſt injurious Character and the moſt unſuitable to the perſons it is faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon, that can be imagined: this I take the great Confidence to do, becauſe I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would be very glad this diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Character, even of Biſhops, ſhould be found a Miſtake, rather than it ſhould be true, to the Diſparagement of the Chriſtian Name.</p>
               <p>It is true, that in the Weſtern Church, the generality of the Clergy, as well as Laity, were ſo grievouſly corrupted; as well in Doctrine as Diſcipline, in ſome of the Ages that were more removed from our Saviour, that we muſt make uſe of God's Vindication of the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Elijah,</hi> to excuſe it from a total De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but for the firſt four or five hundred years (thanks be to God) there is no need of that refuge: for the generality of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of thoſe times, and the Biſhops more eminently, were men of that Holineſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, as reconciled the moſt obſtinate Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt their Religion: men of ſo exact and punctual a Juſtice, of ſo frank and unſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Charity, of ſo ſevere a Temperance, of ſo grave and weigh'd Converſation, that their Memory does ſtill command an univerſal Veneration, and their Examples remain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the degeneracy of after Ages. What ſort of men did the World know, that were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64435:38"/>greater Undervaluers of it? Upon whom did the Temptations of Wealth, or Honour, or Pleaſure, prevail leſs? What Society of men was ever united by ſo powerful Bands of Friendſhip and Affection? No Religion had ever ſo conſtant and faithful Adherers, whom no Danger, no Loſs, no Death could fright from the Acknowledgment of the <hi>Truth, which is after Godlineſs, in hope of eternal Life.</hi> And all this owing next to the Grace of God, and the Precepts of ſo holy a Religion, to the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Example of the Biſhops. It was by their Miniſtry, that Churches were multiplyed, and the Kingdom of Chriſt enlarged: by their Care, that they were preſerved in Peace and Unanimity. Theſe were the great Champions for Religion, that maintainld the Purity of the Faith againſt <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Samoſata, Arrius, Euno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, Photinus, Macedonius, Pelagius, Neſtorius, Eutyches,</hi> and innumerable other peſtilent Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and Overthrowers of the Foundation of our Religion. But with all this, they were men, ſubject to the ſame Paſſions and Miſtakes with us, and if ſome among them were evil men, and the beſt of them had his Failings, it is not to be wondered at, much leſs to be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated, to the Diſparagement of the Order. They were generally, men of ſevere Lives, and that naturally ſharpens the Temper, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it more rigid and uncomplying; they had an extraordinary Zeal for Religion, and that oftentimes made them take Alarme, when it was not in any extream danger; and if their Knowledge and Diſcretion were not always
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64435:39"/>proportionable to their Zeal, ſurely among Chriſtians it might be allowed to the Frailty of Humane Nature, and the Sincerity of a good meaning; If they differ'd ſometimes among themſelves, and were warmer than is fit in their Diſputes; conſider that the Apoſtles themſelves had their Miſunderſtandings, and their Contentions; ſometimes <hi>Peter</hi> was to be blamed, and <hi>Barnabas</hi> was carried away. The Churches founded by the Apoſtles, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately divided about Opinions, which were preſently determined in Council; and yet we do not find that the Controverſie was at an end. Should any one therefore ſo <hi>abridge the Hiſtory</hi> of the Apoſtles, as to repreſent nothing of them, but their unhappy Contention, and leave them under the odious Characters of Diſturbers of the World, and Dividers of the Church? would it not juſtly paſs for a Libel againſt Chriſtianity? It were diſingenious and baſe, even in an Enemy, in a Chriſtian I know not how to call it.</p>
               <p>Having paid this duty to the honour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by a general Vindication of it from ſuch Conſequences as might be drawn from this Church Hiſtory againſt the Intention of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, I come now to his deſign, which is laid down, page 27. <hi>To ſhew the Ignorant ſo much of the matter of Fact, as may tell them who have been the Cauſe of all Church-Corruption, Hereſies, Schiſms, Seditions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And whether ſuch Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan, Prelacies and Grandure, be the Cure, or ever was.</hi>] But ſurely, this is not the way of cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church-diviſions thus to exaſperate. Theſe Reproaches cannot ſerve to heal, but to fret
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64435:39"/>and inflame the Wound; I have ſome hopes that I ſhall be able to ſhew the Reader ſo much of the matter of Fact too, as may let him ſee how much he has been impoſed on by this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and that all Corruptions and Schiſms, are very injuriouſly, and againſt all Truth of Hiſtory, charg'd upon the Biſhops. Yet ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Charge be true, is it ſuch a Wonder, that men of great Talents and great Authority do ſometimes abuſe them, and by that means become the Cauſe of Church-Corruptions? Private men though neither better nor wiſer than the Biſhops, have not the Opportunity of doing ſo much either Good or Hurt, and their Miſtakes or Vices do not draw after them ſo great Conſequences. This Accuſation though it may ſerve to render Biſhops odious, is yet of uſe to prove their Authority, and their ancient poſſeſſion of the right of governing the Church; like his who would prove, that they have troubled the World ever ſince the Apoſtles time. If the abuſe of this Power be ſufficient reaſon to take it away, or to render it odious, what will become of preaching, and writing Books? What will become of Scripture and Conſcience? Let him ſtill exclaim, the Biſhops have been the Authors of all Corruption and Schiſm, were they not Chriſtians and Men as well as Biſhops? and if a Heathen or a Jew ſhould not lay ſuch a Streſs upon the name of Biſhop, but put that of a Chriſtian in it's place, and then make a great Outery, wicked Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians! turbulent Chriſtians! would not this reaſoning hold as well as Mr. B's? or if ſome
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64435:40"/>of the graver Beaſts ſhould recover the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation they had in <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s days, and talk judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, might not they bray aloud, Horrible men! Abominable men! that will never agree or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand one another, and then conclude with the Aſs in the Satyr.</p>
               <q>Ma foy non plus que nous l'home n'eſt qu'une bête.</q>
               <p>Be the Biſhops, whoſe Hiſtory Mr. <hi>B.</hi> writes, as bad as he will have them, how will this concern the reſt of that order, unleſs they will follow their Examples, and own their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: <hi>Machiavel</hi> was of Opinion, that the greateſt part of men were Rogues and Knaves, but what is that to You and I? let every man bear his own Burden.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is reſolved to cut off this Retreat, and to level his Charge, not ſo much againſt the Perſons as the office of Biſhops, and to this effect, he explains himſelf, p. 22. <hi>There is an Epiſcopacy whoſe very Conſtitution is a Crime; and there is another that ſeems to me, a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, lawful, and indifferent, and there is a ſort which I cannot deny to be of divine Right.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Here we have three ſorts of Biſhops, and this is pretty reaſonable and compendious, but in another Book which he refers to in this, he gives no leſs than twelve;<note place="margin">Diſput. of Ch. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment p. 14.</note> dividing was much in Faſhion at that time, though commonly it was without a difference: and as they could make a ſort of Seekers, that neither ſought nor found, ſo he gives ſeveral ſorts of Biſhops that were no more ſo than he or I; nay, in this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64435:40"/>Abridgment of the great Diviſion, I believe the Members will be concident, and that it is but a little artificial Illuſion of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that makes them appear ſeveral; take away the little cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner'd glaſs, and that great multitude of pieces we ſaw, are in a moment reduced to one poor Six-pence, well, let us ſee then, what this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ſort of Epiſcopacy is, and what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has to lay to it's Charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Epiſcopacy which I take in it ſelf to be a Crime, is ſuch as is afore-mentioned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>which in it's very Conſtitution, overthrows the Office, Church and Diſcipline, which Chriſt, by himſelf and his Spirit in his Apoſtles, inſtituted:</hi>] this is criminal indeed and a thouſand Pities it ſhould ſtand one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But where ſhall we find this Abomination? it is not far of, if his Judgment may be taken; for, <hi>Such ſays he, I take to be that Dioceſan kind,</hi>

Had not the Apoſtles? Had not the Evangeliſts ſo too? And was that Conſtitution criminal? Had not the Biſhops of St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Notion ſeveral fixt Aſſemblies? That Father did indeed maintain that the poor Biſhop of <hi>Eugubium</hi> was as much a Biſhop, as he of <hi>Rome;</hi> but he little thought that he was more ſo, or that the Extent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Dioceſs had chang'd the very Species of it's Church Government:<note place="margin">Hieron.

                  </note> he thought they were both of the ſame ſort, and that the ſingle and ſmall Congregation of the one, and the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64435:41"/>numerous Aſſembly under the Inſpection of the other, had made no difference at all in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or conſtitution of their Epiſcopacy; he communicated with, and ſubmitted himſelf in Queſtions of the higheſt moment to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi>

               <p>But let St. <hi>Jerom</hi> think as he pleaſes, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is of another Opinion, and now let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Reaſons.</p>

                  <hi>as having no ruling Paſtors, that have the Power of judging, who to baptize or admit to Communion or Refuſe, but only of Chappels, having Preaching Curates.</hi>] But muſt every Pariſh be an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Church, and exerciſe all Authority and Juriſdiction within it's ſelf? May not ſeveral Pariſhes aſſociate under the Diſcipline of the ſame Biſhop, but that they muſt be unchurch'd? If it be no Church that has no Biſhop, what will become of all Presbyterian Churches, that are ſubject to Claſſes? do not they unchurch Pariſhes as well as Biſhops? But they are made <hi>no Churches for want of governing Paſtors;</hi> this is a great Miſtake, every Pariſh with us has a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Paſtor, but it is in Subordination to the Biſhop, and with Exception to ſome Acts that concern the general Union of all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes

               <p>But <hi>our Paſtors</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſays, <hi>have not the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of judging whom to Baptize,</hi>] this is a Calumny that has not the leaſt Shadow of Truth, and the contrary is notorious: That they have no power to admit to Communion or Refuſe, is not true; they have Power to admit any one that is not excommunicated, or naturally inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; and they may likewiſe refuſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to ſuch as they judge notoriouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but muſt afterwards approve their reaſons to the Biſhop. Several have uſed their Liberty and Diſcretion in this point, without Offence; however, it is but fit, that ſince the peace of the Church does greatly depend upon the right Application of Church-cenſures, there ſhould be a Reſtraint laid upon ordinary Miniſters in this particular; yet there is no Church-cenſure can have any effect, without the Conſent of the Miniſter of that Pariſh where he lives, againſt whom it is directed: The Miniſters Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal indeed may expoſe him to great Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, and it is but juſt, when his Refuſal is only the effect of Oppoſition, yet he has time and opportunity to produce his Reaſons; and why ſhould he deſpair in a juſt Canſe of convincing his Ordinary? However, though the Power of Church-cenſures be not allowed Pariſh Presbyters under Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, it is no Diminution of the right; for neither
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64435:42"/>under the Apoſtles, nor the Primitive Biſhops, did they ever exerciſe it as principals or inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s ſecond Reaſon againſt Dioceſan Epiſcopacy is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>That all the firſt Order of Biſhops in ſingle Churches is depos'd; as if the Biſhop of</hi> Antioch <hi>ſhould have put down a thouſand Biſhops, about him, and made himſelf the ſole Biſhop of the Churches.]</hi> This reaſon goes upon the ſame Suppoſition with the other, that every ſingle Congregation had a Biſhop, the proof of which we will examine in due place. The Biſhops of great Cities had ſeveral Pariſhes or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations under them in the firſt times, which never had any other Biſhops but themſelves; and it was not this but the contrary, that was the fault of great Biſhops and Metropolitans of old: for inſtead of depoſing little Biſhops, they multiply'd them to ſtrengthen their Party in Councils,<note place="margin">Vid. Collat. <hi>Carthag.</hi>
                  </note> when they began to vye with one another in number of Suffrages, as if the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>York</hi> ſhould make every Town under his Juriſdiction, an Epiſcopal Seat, that he might have as many Suffrages as the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> This I hope to prove in due place, and to ſhew the Reader how far Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is miſtaken in the Cauſes of Schiſm, and that nothing contributed more to ſome of them than the multiplying the number of the leſſer Biſhops by their Metropolitans.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His third Reaſon is, <hi>That the Office of Presbyters is changed to Semi-presbyters,]</hi> What then is the Office of a Presbyter? Is it not to preach, and to be the mouth of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64435:42"/>in publick Worſhip? to adminiſter the Sacraments? to exhort? to admoniſh, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the penitent, to viſit the ſick? This all Presbyters in the Church of <hi>England</hi> have full liberty to do; and I wiſh all would take care to execute their Function, as fully as it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Diſcipline is made impoſſible,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note> 
                  <hi>as it is for one General without inferiour Captains, to rule an Army.]</hi> But are there not ſubordinate Officers in the Church, as well as in the Camp? How then is Diſcipline impoſſible? If the General reſerve to himſelf certain Acts of Juriſdiction, does he by that means ſuperſede the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all inferiour Commanders? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is much upon the point of Diſcipline's being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible under Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, becauſe one man, he thinks, cannot govern ſo many Pariſhes. Admit in all things he may not, nor is it neceſſary he ſhould, but in ſuch Acts of Government that are reſerved to him, it is poſſible enough, and has been practiſed from the days of the Apoſtles, to this preſent time. This Point you may find excellently diſcuſs'd by <hi>Mr. Dodwel,</hi> in his ſecond Letter to <hi>Mr. B.</hi> which <hi>Mr. B.</hi> confutes briefly, (<hi>Cb. Hiſt.</hi> 2. part) by telling the Reader, that if he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe reaſons, he has no hopes of him; a ſhort way of confuting, and one would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he that makes uſe of it ſhould write ſo many and great Books of Controverſie. Yet this I muſt add, that if it be impoſſible now, 'tis fit to let the World know who has made it ſo; the Diſſenters themſelves have firſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64435:43"/>weakned the Authority, and obſtructed the Execution of Diſcipline; and when the ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Officers agitated, caballed againſt their Superiour Commanders, it is not wonder if Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be made impracticable. However, the Accuſation ſounds ill from thoſe men, by whoſe Mutiny and ſeditious Practiſes, things have been brought to that evil Paſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. B.</hi> purſues his point further,<note place="margin">§ 55.</note> and adds, <hi>Much more does it become then unlawful, when firſt depoſing all Presbyters from Government by the Keys of Diſcipline they put the ſame Keys, even the Power of decretive Excommunication and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution into the hands of Laymen called Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and ſet up Courts liker to the Civil than Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical.]</hi> It is a Queſtion I cannot eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, whether it be the King or the Biſhop that governs by the Chancellor, but whoever governs by them, they neither have no nought to have the Power of <hi>Deciſive Excommunication,</hi> or the <hi>Power of the Keys,</hi> but act only as Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and judges of matter of Fact, and apply the Canons, which determine what Offences are to be puniſh'd with Excommunication; if they do any more, I neither undertake the Defence, nor will I ſuppoſe thoſe that employ them, own their Actions any farther. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> fall under the ſame Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with our Dioceſans, for their Elders do directly excommunicate, and yet are lay-men. It would be much to the Advantage as well as the Reputation of our Diſſenters, if they would firſt agree, and correct thoſe Abuſes among themſelves, which they ſo ſharply ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt in our Church.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64435:43"/>

                  <note place="margin">§ 56.</note> (continues <hi>Mr. B.</hi>) <hi>by tyrannical Abuſe, when being unable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to exerciſe true Diſcipline (and ſo many hundred Pariſhes) they have multitude of Atheiſts, Infidels, groſs Ignorants, and wicked Livers in Church Communion; yea compel all in their Pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to communicate, upon pain of Impriſonment and Ruine, and turn their Cenſures cruelly againſt godly perſons, that dare not obey them in all their Formalities, Ceremonies, and Impoſitions, for fear of ſinning againſt God.</hi> I am afraid, there are too many wicked men in all Communions, and the Communion, or as they call it, the Religion of the State, will have the moſt, for Reaſons I need not mention: but it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a hard thing to know them, and until they are diſcovered it can be no Reproach to the Diſcipline of the Church that they are in outward Communion, but all <hi>ſorts of People, and theſe with the reſt, are forced into our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.]</hi> They are indeed obliged to come to Church, and to receive the Sacrament three times in the year; but all this is upon the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their being Chriſtians: if they declare to the contrary, they are immediately exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all Church-Juriſdiction; and for the Civil, let them deal with it as well as they can. It is the duty of every Chriſtian to come to Church and receive the Sacrament, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that have been baptiſed and have not

As for the Atheiſts and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels declared, if they are admitted to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it is an unexcuſable fault of Diſcipline, yet ſuch as is to be charged on the Miniſter of the Pariſh that receives them, rather than the Biſhop; and for the being of any ſuch men amongſt us, that is not ſo much to be imputed to the defect of preſent Diſcipline, as to the licentiouſneſs of the late unhappy times, and the Offence that was given to light and unſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy minds, by ſuch pretended Saints as made Religion their Warrant for all their barbarous Villanies they committed.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">§ 56.</note> This is a great Miſtake, for the Biſhop forces no ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, but obliges the Miniſter and Church-wardens of every Pariſh, to preſent ſuch, if any there be, that they might be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Communion, till they ſhall have given ſome Satisfaction to the Church, by their Repentance, and good Hopes of their future Amendment; and laſtly, that <hi>groſs Ignorants are admitted to the Communion,</hi> can be charged upon no other than the Miniſter of that place, whoſe Duty it is, to inſtruct them in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their Religion, and the Biſhops are ſo far from obſtructing the Exerciſe of this Duty, that there is hardly any thing which they preſs with greater Earneſineſs.</p>

               <p>The next Paragraph concludes the Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Dioceſan Biſhops,<note place="margin">§ 57.</note> not with any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, but a great many hard Words, which ſuppoſe the Proofs that have gone before to have amounted to full Evidence.

               <p>Now leaſt you ſhould take <hi>Mr. B.</hi> for an Enemy to Biſhops, for one ſort he rejects he receives two, the firſt, ſuch as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſays <hi>Was brought into the Church for a Remedy againſt Schiſm; the Biſhop of this Conſtitution was it preſide over Presbyters, and without him nothing of Moment was to be done in the Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§ 58.</note> Theſe Presbyters that were under the Biſhop, had they ſeveral Pariſhes or Congregations, or the ſame with their Preſident?

For by old Canons it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, (and <hi>Mr. B.</hi> makes uſe of them to ſerve his own Turn) that a Presbyter was not to

This is to fall into worſe than Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Epiſcopacy, and to make Presbyters, not Preaching, but, what ſounds much meaner, reading Curates only to the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of Biſhops that he dares not deny to be of divine Inſtitution,<note place="margin">§ 60.</note> 
                  <hi>And they are ſuch as ſucceed the Apoſtles in the ordinary part of Church-Government, while ſome ſenior Paſtors have the ſuperviſing Care of many Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> (<hi>as the Viſitors had in</hi> Scotland,) <hi>and are ſo far</hi> Epiſcopi Epiſcoporum, <hi>and Arch-biſhops, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no conſtraining Power of the Sword, but a Power to admoniſh and inſtruct the Paſtors, and to regulate Ordinations, Synods, and all great and common Circumſtances that belong to Churches; for if one Form of Government in which ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors had ſuch extenſive Work and Power</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, Titus, <hi>and Evangeliſts as well us Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had</hi>) <hi>we muſt not change it without Proof, that Chriſt himſelf would have it changed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us compare this with Dioceſan Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and ſee whether for all this mincing of the matter, they will not amount to the ſame thing: this ſuperviſing of many Churches, does it not ſound like having many Pariſhes under them? And if this be impoſſible for a Dioceſan, how comes it to be otherwiſe in an Evangeliſt, or an Apoſtle? Nay, how comes it to be allowed in a <hi>Scotch</hi> Viſitor or Super-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent? The regulating Ordinations is no other in Scripture-Phraſe, than to appoint and ordain Elders in every Church, and in every
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64435:46"/>City; the Dioceſan Biſhops deſire no more in that point, than to have ſuch a Regulation, and that it ſhould not be accounted an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that is done without, or in Oppoſition to them. The Evangeliſts might ſometimes ordain Elders by their own ſingle hands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aſſiſtance of any Presbyter, ſometimes together with the Presbytery; our Dioceſan Biſhops never ordain any to that Order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aſſiſtance of their Presbyters; the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles had the Direction of Church-cenſures,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 2 Cor. 2.9, 10, 11. 1 Tim. 5.19, 20, 21. Tit. 2.15.</note> as appears from frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the new Teſtament; as alſo an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Elders as well as the People, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh and rebuke, and puniſh thoſe that were negligent or diſorderly; The Biſhops claim no more, it is the ſame Authority, it is the ſame Office hitherto, and this is the ſame of what the Biſhops in all Ages of the Church have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſucceed to; they of the Presbyterian way, make all this Power of the Apoſtles, as extraordinary as their Gifts, and to expire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them: but for this they never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any Reaſon; and if this Notion ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it would follow, that neither Presbyters nor Deacons could be ſucceeded in their Offices, becauſe they alſo were inſpired with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts as well as the Apoſtles. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> allows all this, and that they ought to be ſucceeded even in this Eminence and Extent of Work and Power; Why then does he find Fault, and exclaim againſt that which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny to be of divine Inſtitution, and of perpetual Uſe under the name of Dioceſan
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64435:46"/>Epiſcopacy? From theſe men the ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops derived their Title, to this Authority they pretended to ſucceed,<note place="margin">Act. Conc. Tholi. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>24.</hi>

                  <hi>Polycrates</hi> reckons himſelf the ſixth from <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> gives us the ſucceſſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to his time; and if it had been neceſſary to his Purpoſe, did undertake to ſhew the ſame of the Governours of the moſt conſiderable Churches in the World, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Euſebius</hi> has collected out of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Regiſters.<note place="margin">Comment. <hi>1</hi> Ep. ad Timoth.

                  <hi>Salmaſius</hi> a man that never looks behind him, or regards any Conſequence, runs away with this Paſſage as if he had found the greateſt Treaſure in the World, that Biſhop and Presbyter ſignified the ſame thing in the Apoſtles time; and is ſo tranſported that he cannot take any notice that at the ſame time there is a Diſtinction made between the Office of Presbyter and Biſhop: for the Name they anciently bore, ſhews the Nature and Eminency of their Office, that they were Apoſtles in Authority; but the Title be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too great and invidious, they laid it down for an humbler name, and were content with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64435:47"/>the Stile that was common to Presbyters in the Apoſtles time. Hitherto we have an exact Agreement between theſe three ſorts of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and find the Members of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s <hi>moſt compendious Diſtinction,</hi> to be without <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it muſt not be diſſembled, that there are ſome things in which they ſeem to diſagree, eſpecially-theſe two; firſt, That the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts or Apoſtles were unfixt, but Biſhops are determined to a certain Dioceſs. Secondly, That the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts had Biſhops under their Juriſdiction, which Biſhops do not pretend to.</p>
               <p>As to this Unſetledneſs of the Apoſtles, there are ſome that look upon travelling to be ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to their Office, that their Commiſſion is in danger to expire, if they ſhould reſide any conſiderable time in any certain place.<note place="margin">Walo Meſſ. de Epiſe. &amp; Presb.</note> And <hi>Salmaſius</hi> makes ſo acute a Remark upon the Inſcription of St. <hi>John</hi>'s two latter Epiſtles, as comes within a ſmall matter of depoſing him. Before thoſe Epiſtles, he ſtiles himſelf <hi>John</hi> the Presbyter, or the Elder, or it may be in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> no more than <hi>John</hi> the aged; and what would you imagine ſo great a Critick would obſerve from this?

But how comes St. <hi>Paul</hi> to remain three years in the ſame place, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64435:47"/>his Title, and much longer yet at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he dyed in the Exerciſe of his Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> ſpeaking of St. <hi>John,</hi> tells us he went about, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In ſome places he appointed Biſhops where they were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and none but Apoſtolick men could do it; and in ſome places he himſelf govern'd the Church entirely, <hi>i. e.</hi> as their Biſhop, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, appointed another when he left them, to ſucceed in the Charge. <hi>Vales</hi> did not ſee the Import of this Phraſe, but rendred it, <hi>Partim ut eccleſias integras diſponeret &amp; formaret.</hi> The laſt is a Comment that deſtroys the Sence of <hi>Clement,</hi> who by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Now in whatſoever City they lived, beſides the general Care of all the Churches, they lookt upon that as their peculiar Charge, and govern'd not as ordinary Presbyters, but by Apoſtolick Authority: as a Metropolitan; who although he has the ſuperviſing of all the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes within his Province, yet may have his proper Dioceſs which he governs, as a particular Biſhop. And the Office of an Apoſtle does not eſſentially conſiſt in the governing of more Churches than one, elſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64435:48"/>have vindicated his Apoſtleſhip from the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Right he had over the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2.</note> 
                  <hi>If I be not an Apoſtle to others, yet doubtleſs I am to you, for the Seal of my Apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord.</hi> So that though he had had no more Churches to govern, yet his Apoſtolick Authority might have been ſtill exerciſed over that particular one of <hi>Corinth.</hi> The Provinces of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts were not yet ſo large as thoſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, for theſe were either ſent to ſuch Cities or Parts, whither the Apoſtles themſelves could not go, or left where they could not ſtay: The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was the Dioceſe of <hi>Timothy,</hi> from whence although the greater Occaſions of other Churches might call him away, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his Aſſiſtance, yet his Authority was not Temporal, nor would it have expired, if he had reſided a longer while at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> ſo that theſe Apoſtolick men were not ſo becauſe they were unfixt, but becauſe they had that Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Authority, which they might exerciſe in one or more Churches, according as their Neceſſities did require, or as the Spirit ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: and that they did not ſettle in one place is to be aſcribed to the Condition of their Times, and not to the nature of their Office: for the Harveſt was now great, and ſuch La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers as theſe were but few, and therefore their Preſence was required in ſeveral Places. And as this Unſetledneſs is not eſſential to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Authority, no more is it eſſential to Epiſcopacy to be determined to a certain Church. Every Biſhop is Biſhop of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and that his Authority is confined
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64435:48"/>to a certain diſtrict, is only the poſitive Law of the Church, that forbids one Biſhop any Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his Office within the Dioceſs of another; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to have given them the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, who would not <hi>build upon another mans Foundation.</hi> However, in any caſe of Neceſſity, this Poſiture Law is ſuperſeeded, and a Biſhop may act in any place, by virtue of a general Power he has received in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: ſo that this firſt Exception of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and the Evangeliſts being unfixt, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops determined to a particular Church, can make no eſſential Difference.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Viſitors</hi> of the <hi>Church of Scotland,</hi> they make evidently againſt Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Notion of an eſſential Difference between Biſhops and Evangeliſts; for firſt of all, the Reſidence was fixt to certain Cities, and their Juriſdiction confin'd within certain Provinces, as the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent of the Country of <hi>Orkney</hi> was to keep his Reſidence in the Town of <hi>Keirkwall,</hi>

                  </note> and their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64435:49"/>practice was altogether the ſame with that of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, as Biſhop <hi>Spotſwood</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, <hi>The Superintendents held their Office during Life, and their Power was Epiſcopal, for they did elect and ordain Miniſters, they preſided in Synods, and directed all Church Cenſures, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was any Excommunication pronounced without their Warrant.</hi> And now let the Reader judge how the Conſtitution of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy becomes a Crime, and yet theſe Viſitors of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> conformable to divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond Exception, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Evangeliſts were <hi>Epiſcopi Epiſcoporum,</hi> and had Biſhops under their Juriſdiction, which our Dioceſans, who are the Biſhops but of particular Churches, do not pretend to; This makes no Difference, at leaſtwiſe no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial one, for the ſame perſon may have the Charge of a particular Church or Dioceſs, and yet have the ſuperviſing Power over ſeveral others. But in this point Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does but equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate and impoſe upon his Reader; for by his <hi>Epiſcopus gregis</hi> he means only a Presbyter, and a particular Biſhop may have Juriſdiction over ſuch, without any Injury or Prejudice done to the Office, which from it's firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution has been under the Direction of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Apoſtolical Power: if therefore theſe Presbyters do retain all that Power which eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially belongs to them under a Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, how are they degraded? In ſhort, either this Order of Congregational Epiſcopacy is different from Presbytery, or the ſame with it;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64435:49"/>if the ſame, how is it abrogated by Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, ſince Presbyters are ſtill in the full Poſſeſſion and Exerciſe of their Office. If they are diſtinct how then comes Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them as he does, § 16. where he ſays, <hi>That the Apoſtles themſelves ſet more than one of theſe Elders or Biſhops in every Church.</hi> So then thoſe Apoſtolick men, as Biſhops of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches wherin as they reſided, had Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over Presbyters within the Extent of their Dioceſs, and a general Superviſing Care of ſeveral other Churches, and ſo they were <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi Epiſcoporum:</hi> in the firſt, they are ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Dioceſan Biſhops, in the latter, by <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans,</hi> which yet were never lookt upon as two orders eſſentially diſtinct.</p>
               <p>But after all this we ſhall never come to a right Underſtanding of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Epiſcopacy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we take along with it, his Notion of a particular Church, which he ſets down, <hi>p.</hi> 6. § 19. <hi>There is great Evidence of Hiſtory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>that a particular Church of the Apoſtles ſetling was eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially only [a Company of Chriſtians, Paſtors, and People, aſſociated for perſonal holy Communion, and mutual help in holy Doctrine, Worſhip, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and Order] therefore it never conſiſted of ſo few or ſo many, or ſo diſtant as to be uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch perſonal Help and Communion, but was ever diſtinguiſhed as from accidental Meetings, ſo from the Communion of many Churches or diſtant Chriſtians, which was held but by Delegates, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, of Paſtors or Letters, and not by perſonal Help in Preſence. Not that all theſe muſt needs always meet in the ſame place, but that uſually
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64435:50"/>they did ſo, or at due times at leaſt, and were no more, nor more diſtant than could ſo meet, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Perſecution hindred them, ſometimes the Room might be too ſmall, even independent Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es among us ſometimes meet in diverſe Places, and one Pariſh has diverſe Chappels for the aged and weak that are unfit for Travel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every one of theſe Churches then had one Biſhop, and was, in his Opinion, all the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of apoſtolical and ancient Biſhops. If in any City or Town the number of Chriſtians ſhould exceed what might meet in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, that then they were to imitate the <hi>Commonwealth of Bees, who when they grow too numerous for one hive, ſend out new Colonies,</hi> commanded by their own Officers; ſo when Chriſtians grew too many for perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Doctrine and Worſhip, they muſt reſolve themſelves into ſeveral Churches, and have as many independent Biſhops, as they have Congregations.</p>
               <p>But this model of a Church I am afraid is like to pleaſe no Party: for the Diſſenters are of Opinion we have too many Biſhops already, but this Project would make more Biſhops in this one City, than are now in the three Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has elſewhere endeavoured to take away this Prejudice,<note place="margin">Diſp. 1. of Ch. Gov. Ch. Hiſt. part 2.</note> by ſaying, that thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Biſhops he is for, are not of the ſame ſort with ours: 'tis true indeed, Dioceſes are not to be ſo large, yet their Power within their own Church, is to be equal to the others within their Dioceſs; and the Church would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64435:50"/>fare no better in this Caſe, than the Empire did in the times of <hi>Galienus,</hi> when the People, generally diſcontented with his Government, becauſe it was too remiſs, found themſelves immediately enſlaved by no leſs than thirty Tyrants. The Presbyterians would never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that the Power of their Claſſes and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, ſhould be ſettled in congregational Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and the Independent's Principles will as little admit this Project: the <hi>Eraſtian</hi> Party will allow this Biſhop no Power of Cenſures or Church Diſcipline. <hi>Lewis Moulin,</hi>

               <p>The Epiſcopal men are content with the preſent Form, and do not deſire the Biſhops ſhould be multiplyed; at leaſt, not according to this Project: for this, in their Judgment, would lie heavier than the Burden of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> So that I cannot ſee what party or principles this would ſuit, beſides the Authors own, nor

                  </note> but that the people there were inſtructed by Prieſts and Monks, makes nothing at all to our preſent purpoſe, though the Authority of <hi>Henricus Major,</hi> and <hi>Johannes Fordorius</hi> were unqueſtionable, for there is no account of ſetled Churches or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, but only that ſome good men out of their Zeal for Religion, did endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate it among the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that theſe were not Biſhops. But <hi>Buchanan</hi> ſtretches this point higher than it will bear, and will have it, that the Churches of <hi>Scotland</hi> were governed by Presbyters and Monks, the firſt time; I believe in Story we meet with Monks amongſt the Orders of Church-Government: but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Story it ſelf may be eaſily diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and we may expect ſhortly a fuller ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this and other things, relating to the ancient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Church, by the hand of one of the greateſt Maſters of Antiquity in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The laſt part of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Evidence has ſome of the Canons of ancient Councils, but I muſt needs ſay, he does not cite with that accuracy, that one would expect from a perſon that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances ſo ſingular a notion; The firſt is the

                  <note place="margin">Can 1.</note> the Sum of it is this, that if any man ſhould deſire a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Eaſe for the benefit of his Family, he might be gratified in it, but with this Proviſo, that upon the moſt ſolemn Feaſts he ſhould hear divine Service in <hi>Parochiis aut Civitatibus.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes <hi>Parochia</hi> ſignifie a Dioceſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word is uſed frequently in that ſenſe by <hi>Euſebius</hi> and other Ancients, but does not conſider, that the Import of it is changed by this time, and is taken for a Pariſh in the fifty third Canon of the Council of <hi>Adge,</hi> whoſe Title is <hi>de Presbyteris parochianis rei Eccleſiae di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrahentibus; &amp; cap.</hi> 2. <hi>vaſſ.</hi> 3.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64435:57"/>all probability be underſtood: By the ſecond, the Prieſts Benediction, that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced at the diſmiſſing the Congregation; or if he will underſtand a Biſhop by <hi>Sacerdos,</hi> the Canon forbids it, in making a Diſtinction between them, <hi>ab Epiſcopo confundatur;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if by <hi>Sacerdos</hi> they would have underſtood a Biſhop, it is not likely they would have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chang'd the Term, or repeated it, but have added, <hi>ab eo confundatur.</hi> But why ſhould we inſiſt upon this, ſince nothing can be more notorious, than that Presbyters had Churches now diſtinct from Biſhops, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Dioceſs almoſt a great number of Pariſhes, and there are few Councils of that Age, but oblidge the Biſhop to viſit all theſe Churches once a year.</p>
               <p>To theſe he adds the thirty eighth Canon of the ſame Council,<note place="margin">Diſp. <hi>p.</hi> 99.</note>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64435:58"/>more than 47 Canons of this Council, the reſt were taken out of <hi>Conc.

               </p>
               <p>The next of the Canons he produces are either to the ſame effect with what he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready alledged, or not directly to his purpoſe, ſo that I believe upon a Review he will judge as well as I that there is no neceſſity of a Reply.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:64435:58"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. B.</hi> has heretofore excepted, the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ch. Hiſt. p. 7. § 23.</note> and has deſpair'd of bringing them ever to comply with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del; but now it ſeems he has found a means to reduce them to a Congregation: he revokes his former Conceſſions, and declares, that he finds no reaſon to believe (that ever the two chief Cities of the Empire had ſo long; that is, for two hundred years after Chriſt, more than ſome <hi>London</hi> Pariſhes, or near half ſo many) it is Pity theſe great <hi>London</hi> Pariſhes ſhould ever be divided, they are ſo ſerviceable to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters on all Occaſions; for if a Conventicle is to be kept up, the Greatneſs of St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s or St. <hi>Giles</hi> Pariſh will juſtifie it; thoſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es will not hold a tenth man that ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to them, and ſurely, better ſet up a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Law, than that the People go unedified. And again, when <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> are to be reduced to a ſingle Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then it is but comparing them to theſe great Pariſhes, and the work is done; <hi>It is not likely, that for two hundred years,</hi> Rome <hi>it ſelf had near ſo great a number of Chriſtians as one of theſe Pariſhes.</hi> Suppoſe they had not, the Queſtion is not whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was more numerous than that of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> but whether they could meet in one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for ſuppoſe they were but half, or a quarter ſo big, if they could not meet in one place to hear the Word and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but muſt reſolve into ſeveral Aſſemblies for to do it, it is no matter what proportion they held to our <hi>London</hi> Pariſhes.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:64435:59"/>
               <p>But what Evidence is there out of Hiſtory, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> made but one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation for two hundred years after Chriſt, is it that the People are ſaid to conſent to the Election of the Biſhops, or to concur in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Eccleſiaſtical Acts? But how ſhall we be aſſured, that every Believer was obliged to be preſent, or that Matters were carried by Vote; and not by general and confuſed Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Beſides, though all that had the right of Electing Church Officers might poſſibly meet in one place, yet they were not the fifth part of the number that had right to Congregation and Perſonal Communion; for Women and Children, and Servants muſt be ſuppoſed to be excluded, together with the Poor, and the more inconſiderable Perſons: or if this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of approving the Election of Church-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers be any Argument for a Churches being no more than a ſingle Congregation, it will follow, that <hi>Rome</hi> had but one Congregation for many hundred years after, for the People were very long in poſſeſſion of that right, after the whole City was become Chriſtian, and ſurely then they were too numerous for one Congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anton. de Dom. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 11. makes a long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Election of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and proves that they were choſen by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, until <hi>Innocent</hi> the Second, for 1100 years, and that he was the firſt that alter'd the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient way of Election; Now if any one can believe, that for eleven Centuries there was but one Congregation in <hi>Rome,</hi> much good may it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64435:59"/>do him. As for the Peoples Right to chuſe, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does ſo much inſiſt upon, and ſeems to give the People Encouragement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from thoſe Biſhops, which they never choſe. I ſhall give a more particular Account of it towards the latter end of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes a Computation of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and finds it to fall much ſhort of one of our great Pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; for when <hi>Novatian</hi> divided that Church, it had but forty ſix Prieſts, ſeven Deacons, and as many Sub-deacons, forty two Acoluti, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſts, Readers, and Porters fifty two, Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Poor that were diſabled, and lived upon the Charity of the Church, fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: upon which we compute thus, Suppoſe the Poor the tenth part of the whole Church, (as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> calculated the number of the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi>) the Product then would be fifteen thouſand, and not ten thouſand five hundred, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> reckons, or the Printer mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, and even thus, would they be too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for one Congregation. We cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any five Churches of ſuch as the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans might be ſuppoſed then to have,<note place="margin">Ch.

               <p>In the next place let us conſider the number of the Prieſts, what uſe can there be of forty ſix in one Congregation? For they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to preach nor adminiſter the Sacraments in the Preſence of the Biſhop; for the firſt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> urged it elſewhere to prove no more than one Congregation belong'd to one Biſhop, and I hope he will not be ſo diſingenious as to caſt it off as ſoon as he has ſerv'd his turn of it. For the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Martyr</hi> is very clear in his Deſcription, that the Biſhop conſecrated and gave it the Deacons to be diſtributed among the Congregation:<note place="margin">ubi ſupra.</note> ſo that unleſs there were diſtinct Congregations at that time, thoſe 46 Presbyters could hardly find how to employ themſelves.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does endeavour to remove this Objection,<note place="margin">Ch.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64435:61"/>have been ſpoke? No longer than about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years, and after one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Revolutions that happen'd in the Church in <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s time: the Chriſtians as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, were not of the greateſt and richeſt, and therefore it is not likely that the publick Charge ſhould be multiplyed without Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and forty ſix Presbyters be appointed for one Congregation. But in <hi>Nazianzen</hi>'s time the Church was in a proſperous and flouriſhing Condition, the Governours were now become Chriſtians, and great Priviledges and Wealth were added to the Clergy, which made it then ſo deſireable a thing. But in <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s time the greateſt Dignity was Martyrdom, and the Clergy was particularly aim'd at by the Heathen Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, their Portion was Labour and Danger, they were to come and aſſiſt the Brethren in the Priſon and at the Stake; and the Office was ſo unpleaſant, that <hi>Novatian</hi> (the Author of that Sect which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſpeaks ſo favourably of) deſired to be eaſed of the Burden,<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The great Liberality of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no ſmall Argument of its Greatneſs, for, beſides the maintenance of their own Clergy and Poor, they were able to relieve moſt other Churches,<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>14.</hi> c. <hi>23.</hi>

[<hi>Mareotes,</hi> ſays Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius, <hi>is a Countrey belonging to</hi> Alexandria, <hi>wherein there never was a Biſhop, not ſo much as a</hi> Chorepiſcopus, <hi>but all the Churches of that place were ſubject to the Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria. And now let the Reader judge, whether the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had more Congregations than one under him, or no more than could conveniently meet in one place.</p>
               <p>I have hitherto examin'd Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Evidence of Hiſtory for his Congregational Churches: let us now ſee whether there be not as good Evidence to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The growth of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſo ſudden, and ſo great, as to exceed the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of one or two Congregations. St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s firſt Sermon brought over three thouſand, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other five thouſand;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41.</note> then the Sacred Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, as if the Multitude had grown too great
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64435:69"/>to be numbred, mentions the other Acceſſions in groſs and indefinitely, but with ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as imply, they much exceed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers aforementioned: <hi>Multitudes both of Men and Women were added to the Church, and the number of the Diſciples multiplyed in</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>greatly; and a great number of the Prieſts were obedient to the Faith,</hi> Act. 6.7. Now let us ſeriouſly conſider, whether all theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts could meet together in one place, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Communion, Doctrine and Worſhip, or whether they could find a room ſpacious enough to meet in all together; we find but two ſorts of places they met in, the Temple, and from Houſe to Houſe; the Temple cannot be ſuppoſed the ordinary place of their Aſſembly, ſince the generality of the Prieſts and People did oppoſe them; and though the Apoſtles preacht there, it was no otherwiſe than they did in the Synagogues acd Market-places, and other places of concourſe, to gain new Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, and not to inſtruct thoſe they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: when they preacht from Houſe to Houſe, the fifth or tenth part of them can hardly be ſuppoſed to have convenience for perſonal Communion: and it is certain, they did break Bread no otherwiſe than <hi>from Houſe to Houſe,</hi> from whence it is plain, that it was not poſſible for them all to hold perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the principal part of Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>i. c.</hi> the holy Euchariſt, which is made by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as neceſſary to the Individuation of a Church as Communion in Doctrine. The Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians preſt this Inſtance very unmercifully
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64435:70"/>upon thoſe of the congregational way, who made uſe of all Shifts, and moſt of them very poor ones. To elude the force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſometimes they turn the Temple into a Church, another while they ſend the greateſt part of them home to the country, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever other means they could find to diminiſh their number, they laid hold of them; and this way not ſucceeding in their own Opinion, they found a Secret in the Ayr,<note place="margin">Grand Debate.

                  </note> which they fancied to be much more pure, and ſhine in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> than our <hi>Northern</hi> Climates, and ſo more proper to convey a Voice to a greater Diſtance; whereas, our dull unyielding Fog, arreſts the Voice in every point, as it paſſes. However, the Aſſembly of Divines reſolved they would not be paid with this piece of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and undertook to ſhew the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be as thin as the Ayr they talkt of; and the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> relieves them in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, who was of Opinion, that a Voice could be heard much farther in a groſs than a pure Ayr, the Reſiſtance perhaps preſerving it lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as Oppoſition ſerves, to lengthen a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and to make Diſputes endleſs;<note place="margin">p. 81.82. but in the ſecond part of Ch.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64435:70"/>that our Fore-fathers were Giants. For my part the next thing I expect is, that they ſhould believe with <hi>Kirker</hi> that the Ancients knew the uſe of Sir <hi>Samuel Morland</hi>'s ſpeaking-trumpet, for <hi>Kirker</hi> had a Viſion of ſome old Manuſcript that no body elſe ever ſaw, which revealed to him, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great could ſpeak to his whole Army together, by the help of a Trumpet; and who can tell, but in this vaſt Congregation of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſuch an Engine might be made uſe of? However, ſince Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are to be no larger than the Sphear of a man's Voice, it will be an uſeful Inſtrument to a Preacher, of weak Lungs, to ſtretch out the Bounds of his Dioceſs, and be as ſerviceable to the Church as it is to the Camp.<note place="margin">Diſp. of Ch. Gov. <hi>p.</hi> 81.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells us one thing more which a Friend told him, which I wonder as much, he ſhould believe, as that he be ſatisfied with another Friend's Computation of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Strabo</hi>'s time: 'tis in ſhort this, That, he, though his Voice was none of the lowdeſt, yet he preacht to a Congregation judg'd to be about ten thouſand men,<note place="margin">2 part of Ch. Hiſt. in one place he has but 6000. but in another he comes up again to 10000.</note> and that they all hear'd him; I am afraid that this Friends Calculation exceeds as much as the other falls ſhort; for we reckon now, that three thouſand makes an extraordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and it may be poſſible for a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Voice to ſpeak to a thouſand more, but it may be, that the World is degenerated ſince, and that our Lungs are no more in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with thoſe of the times he ſpeaks of, than they were compared to thoſe of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Preachers.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:64435:71"/>
               <p>At laſt, to make ſure work, he concludes that though <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might have many Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies and yet but one Church,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 81. <hi>&amp;</hi> 82.</note> and after the diſperſing of the Apoſtles, but one Biſhop, yet this is no Precedent; This I muſt needs ſay, is ſomething more than the Independents would adventure to ſay, they minced the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and told us, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being the firſt born Church, and nurſed up by the joynt care of all the Apoſtles might arrive to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Stature, and look gigantick, in Compariſon of the reſt, yet they durſt not ſay it had more than one Congregation, and was no Precedent: What ſhall we judge then? That the Apoſtles built the Church of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> after one model, and thoſe of other Cities after another, or if they did, ſurely they were both lawful; does that overthrow the Church and Diſcipline of Chriſt's Inſtitution, that is, according to the practice of his own Apoſtles? Or can a Conformity to the Diſcipline of the Mother-church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> become in it's ſelf a Sin? Wherein ſhall we be ſaved if the Imitation of the Apoſtles do not ſecure us?</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſays, the Office of a Biſhop ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes him to have no more than one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ſince he muſt hold perſonal Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with all, in Preaching, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments, viſiting the Sick, relieving the Poor, and the like: but muſt all theſe Acts be performed by himſelf in Perſon? Muſt he have no Aſſiſtance? Is nothing to be done within his Congregation, without his Preſence? May not he do all this occaſionally,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64435:71"/>as the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts did,<note place="margin">Every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop had Presbyters in the firſt times, and if he were ſo indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably oblig'd to do all himſelf, what uſe were they of?</note> and yet appoint Elders for the ordinary and conſtant Performance of the Miniſtry, whom he ſhall ſuperviſe and direct? It is very ſtrange, that the Biſhops ſhould have been ſo many hundred years in an Office, which it was impoſſible for them to diſcharge, and yet this be never diſcover'd by themſelves or others.</p>
               <p>However, the generality of Biſhops (you ſay) for a long while after the Apoſtles, had but one Congregation to govern; what then? If all the Believers in and about a City, would hardly make a Congregation, that is, to be aſcribed to the Condition of thoſe times, and not to be reckon'd eſſential to the Office: all things have their Beginning, but are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to the Meaſures of their Infancy; and if the Beginnings of the Church were but ſmall, even the greateſt Cities, it cannot be a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Governour of it, if the number of Believers ſhould increaſe, ſince they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in <hi>Clemens</hi> Opinion, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not only of thoſe that have already,<note place="margin">Ep. ad Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</note> but of ſuch as ſhall afterwards believe.</p>
               <p>The Practice of the univerſal Church, is evidently on our ſide, for who has ever heard of two Biſhops in one City, though it were never ſo great, unleſs in time of Schiſm: and it is ſtrange, when the number of Believers did encreaſe beyond all Poſſibility of perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that none ſhould ever diſcern the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of dividing into ſeveral Churches, and learn this Wiſdom from the Example of Bees; <hi>But the Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Alexandria <hi>by their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64435:72"/>Affectation of Empire, became evil Examples to others by their firſt Corruption of Church Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</hi> It is ſtrange then, that among all the Quarrels of the Biſhops, and in all their Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of one another, that this Crime of ſo high a Nature, ſhould never be objected, that no good man could never complain of this Corruption, that there ſhould never be laid to their Charge this uſurping of Authority over whole Cities and multitudes of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But ſuppoſing this an Uſurpation in the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> how is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that all the great Cities in the World ſhould be carryed away with their Example? that there ſhould be not one honeſt Biſhop left, that underſtood the nature of his Office, or the juſt bounds of his Dioceſs? Or ſuppoſe the Biſhops ſo far prejudiced with ſelf-Intereſt as to have neglected a Duty that redounded ſo much to the Diminution of their Power, yet were the People who in thoſe times had ſome part in their Election, ignorant of this great Secret, would not they right themſelves, and not have ſuffer'd their ſeveral Congreations to become Chappelries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Dependencies upon the Biſhops Church? Would not they have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd themſelves, rather than become, as it were, a Province to the Biſhop; or if the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ignorant of this, was there no Prieſt that was ambitious enough to be Biſhop, that could inform them of their Right, in Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation that they would be grateful to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer of their Priviledges. And laſtly, was there no Schiſmatick learned enough to juſtifie
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64435:72"/>his ſetting up of an Altar againſt an Altar, by this Argument, that there were more Believers than could hold perſonal Communion with the Biſhops Altar; that there was work enough for more Biſhops than one, and that in popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Cities there ought to be ſeveral Churches: yet they were all ſo dull, as never to think of this way, but on the contrary, every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that there ought to be but one Biſhop in a City, and that himſelf had the Right, and the other was the Uſurper.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, ſince the Nature of the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that it ſhould ſwarm, when Believers grew too numerous for one Aſſembly, and ſend out new Colonies under Independant-officers, Is it not very ſtrange, that it ſhould ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it's Nature, as never to have done this, and to leave not one poor inſtance, upon whoſe Authority, the Independency of Congregations might relye? It is upon this, that the preſent Queſtion turns, and not whether Biſhops at firſt had but ſingle Congregations; for if there were no more Believers within, or belonging to the City, they could have no more; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were multiplyed into ſeveral Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, ſtill they had but one Biſhop: and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does not as much as pretend to any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Hiſtory to the contrary, unleſs it be, when the Church was divided by Schiſm.</p>
               <p>I thought my ſelf obliged to conſider Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Notion of a Church and Epiſcopacy, as it lyes ſcatter'd in his firſt Chapter, and explain'd more at large in his firſt Diſputation of Church Government; partly becauſe he inſiſts ſo much
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64435:73"/>upon it, and bends the whole courſe of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory to favour it as much as is poſſible; partly, becauſe he makes it a plea to juſtifie his Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt Biſhops and Councils, as if thoſe he diſhonoured in this Hiſtory, had departed from the ancient uſe of Church Government and Diſcipline; and their Uſurpation had drawn after it all thoſe evil Conſequences and Calamities, which he relates throughout this Book. It is time now to enter upon his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to examine how truly and how fairly he has repreſented the Actions of Biſhops and Councils, I ſhall go along with him as far as the end of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to vindicate the Reputation of the four firſt general Councils, which our Church receives, from thoſe injurious Repreſentations which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has made of them in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
               <p>In the next place, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew how little Truth there is in that general Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation which this Hiſtory is intended to make out, that Biſhops have been the Authors of all Hereſies, Schiſms, and Corruptions: Thirdly, that the way to remedy this, is not by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying Biſhops, and that this Expedient is ſo far from being the Cure of Church Diviſions, that nothing has contributed more to widen the Breach, and to render Peace and Concord impoſſible within any conſiderable Compaſs. Fourthly, That though Biſhops and Councils have been guilty of great Miſcarriages, they ought not to be imputed to the Order, but the Men; and if Biſhops brought in ſeveral Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64435:73"/>as well in Doctrine as Diſcipline after the four general Councils; Biſhops have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reformed the Church from them, and have maintained, and do ſtill maintain and juſtifie their Reformation. Laſtly, that latter models of Church-Governments without Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have been ſubject to all the Miſcarriages that are charg'd upon the Biſhops, and have not been able to prevent or remedy the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of Hereſies and Schiſms, and that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent model is of all other, the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to remedy theſe Miſchiefs, and is juſtly charg'd by the Presbyterians to have given the occaſion to all thoſe Confuſions in Religion, thoſe monſtrous Doctrines and endleſs Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, under which we ſtill labour, and almoſt deſpair to ſee a Remedy for them.</p>

               <p>'Tis this that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> finds ſo much fault with, and aſcribes all the miſchiefs that have befallen the Church, to an ignorant zeal againſt Hereſie: There is no doubt but this has been the occaſion of great Calamities, the greateſt Hereticks perſecuting the Truth under the name of Hereſie:<note place="margin">p. 31. §. 15. p. 32.</note> the <hi>Arrians</hi> were exceeding violent againſt the Orthodox Believers, and uſed all manner of Cruelties to reduce them from the right way, which they called Hereſie; they, on the other ſide, returned the infamous name, though not the barbarous treatment, upon their Enemies; and what ſhall we infer from hence? that there is no Hereſie, becauſe Truth is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> gives ſuch an account of thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies that exerciſed the four firſt General Councils, as ſeems in great meaſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thoſe Hereſies which were condemn'd by them, and to blame their condemnation, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Biſhops, in deriſion, <hi>Hereticators</hi> and <hi>Damners,</hi> becauſe they pronounced <hi>Arrius, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonius, Neſtorius,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </note> he makes a Catalogue of ſuch Errours, which men ought to be reſtrain'd from preaching and propagating: now all thoſe Errours condemn'd by the four firſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, are laid down there, not only in the Senſe, but in the very Terms they were condemn'd in; theſe Doctrines are by him own'd to be dangerous, and by no means to be ſuffered to be preach'd.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64435:76"/>his Reſolution is very moderate, that every one ſhould not be ejected or ſilenced, that holdeth or preacheth any one ſuch Errour what then? muſt he be ſuffer'd to propagate the Infections, and to teach theſe Opinions that are ſo confeſſedly dangerous? nor that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for there follows ſuch an Exception in this Toleration, as wholly overthrows it; for thoſe are to be caſt out, who, <hi>conſideratis conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derandis,</hi> are found to do more harm than good: Now, what if the Orthodox Biſhops did find that, <hi>conſideratis conſiderandis,</hi> thoſe Hereticks they condemned, did more hurt than good, that they deſtroy'd with one hand much more than they edified with the other; and that the propagating of one of theſe dangerous Doctrines was not compenſated by all the other Truths that they preach'd; there is no variety of wholſom food can countervail the Miſchiefs of one envenom'd bit; and that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician is not to be truſted that puts in any one dangerous Ingredient, though the reſt of the Compoſition were very innocent, and this was the Rule they went by; the Hereticks in their Opinions were dangerous men, they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in their Opinions, induſtrious in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating them, and were moſtly upon the vindication of theſe controverted Doctrines: it was therefore neceſſary, ſince they did more hurt than good, that they ſhould be caſt out of the Church.</p>

               <p>It is obſervable, that before this time we do not meet any very numerous Councils, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Africk</hi> or any where elſe; the greateſt falling much ſhort of a hundred; which ſhews, that Biſhops were not yet ſo much multiplied, and that their Biſhopricks were of a larger Extent; but theſe Schiſmaticks ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving divided the Church, made Biſhops in every Village to ſtrengthen their Party, and to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>number the Orthodox; beſides that, they had ſet up an Altar,<note place="margin">p. 4. § 44.</note> and made them Biſhops in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City, where they could get the leaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to joyn with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> complains, upon this Occaſion, <hi>That ſome Popiſh Perſons liken the Separatiſts among us to the</hi> Donatiſts; who thoſe <hi>Popiſh</hi> Perſons are, I will not pretend to gheſs; However, this I am ſure, that the word Hereſie of old was never worſe abus'd, than that of Popery is now; for whomſoever men have a mind to render odious to the People, it is ſufficient to call him Popiſh, and then he is baited under that infamous name, as the Chriſtians ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were in the Skins of Beaſts: But if a man had a mind to make odious Compariſons, Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Defence of our Separatiſts from the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of being like the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them but little Service.

               <p>The ſucceeding Councils of <hi>Ancyra, Neocae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea,</hi> and two of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> eſcaped with pretty good Quarter; the Acts of ſome not diſpleaſing him, and of others being loſt.</p>
               <p>The next is that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 42. § 49. They were ſo few, that without Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers good Canons.</note> of 32 Biſhops; not ſo few, but they could have fallen out, if they had been ſo diſpoſed; three Canons of this Council, he cites in favour of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church: The forty ſixth <hi>requires, That thoſe that are to be baptized, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready baptized,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tranſlates) <hi>ſhould learn the Creed, and repeat it to the Biſhop or Presbyters, on the Friday of the laſt Week, i. e.</hi> of the <hi>Lent,</hi> or any other, next preceeding the day of ſolemn Baptiſm. <hi>By this,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>B. You may conjecture how large a Biſhoprick then was.</hi> They might be as large as ours for all this: For though the Biſhop may not hear them all himſelf, upon the ſame day yet the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64435:82"/>of his Dioceſs may, and the Canon is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with that: And <hi>Canon</hi> 56 <hi>forbids the Presbyters to go into the Church before the Biſhop, but with him:</hi> and Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Inference from hence, is, <hi>That every Church had a Biſhop, though ſome Chappels afar off, had but Presbyters only.</hi> But I cannot ſee what Service this Remark does him; for 'tis confeſſed, that no Biſhop had but one Cathedral, and that is the Church meant here in the Canon; for it is added, <hi>Nec ſedere in Tribunalibus,</hi> which were put up on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Epiſcopal Church; but that there were other Pariſh Churches ſupplied by Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and thoſe far from the Cathedral, is acknowledged by Mr. B. I will not contend with him about their Title, whether they were Churches or Chappels; it is ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his Notion, that they were ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. Canon 57. <hi>It is order'd that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould not be ordain'd in Villages and Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets:</hi> The Canon does not diſtinguiſh between the ſmall and great, putting Villages indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, but inſtead of Biſhops they were to have <hi>Viſitors,</hi> i. e. <hi>qui circum eant,</hi> that ſhould <hi>go about, and viſit them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§ 49.</note> which Expreſſion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that there was no ſmall number of them under the ſame Aſſociation, and yet, all theſe were under the Biſhop of the City, upon which they depended, and their Viſitor was to do nothing without his Knowledge or Privity; which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tranſlates Conſcience:<note place="margin">Sine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia Ep. nibil faciant.</note> But leaſt he ſhould have forgot the thirteenth <hi>Canon,</hi> or taken no notice of it, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to his conſideration; it is but

               <p>That great <hi>Roman</hi> Council, of two hundred ſeventy five Biſhops,<note place="margin">p. 43. p. 53. this is confeſs'd to be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe if not all.</note> which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mentions out of <hi>Crabb,</hi> is of ſo little Credit, as either not to be taken notice of by the following Compilers, or elſe, as is moſt probable, is ſet down elſewhere; for <hi>Crabb</hi> ſets them down twice. <hi>It is uncertain,</hi> ſays Mr. B. <hi>whether it was before or after the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council:</hi> for my part, I believe it was neither before nor after, but juſt the ſame time with the other great <hi>Roman</hi> Council, that follows next to it, of 284 Biſhops, which is ſaid to be held <hi>after that,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> Conſtantine <hi>was baptized by</hi> Sylveſter: <hi>A hundred and twenty nine Biſhops came to this latter from the City of</hi> Rome, <hi>and not far from it: How big were Biſhopricks then ſays Mr.</hi> B.?</p>
               <p>But had there been no more Biſhops in <hi>Italy</hi> than were in this Council, they would not have exceeded the number of Chriſtians in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> when <hi>Strabo</hi> deſcribed it. After this he finds fault with ſeveral things in this imaginary Synod; firſt, <hi>Becauſe men are curs'd for being ignorant of the time of the Moon; and then he congratulates the Makers and Improvers of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Liturgy,</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid the Almanack-makers) <hi>that they did not live in thoſe ſevere times: For alas! one year they miſtook the time of</hi> Eaſter, <hi>and this is one of the things for
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64435:83"/>which two thouſand Miniſters are ſilenc'd, for not declaring Aſſent, Conſent, and Approbation of, yea, and the uſe of it, and ſo to keep</hi> Eaſter <hi>at a wrong time.</hi> The ſilenc'd Miniſters have little Reaſon to thank him; or any body elſe, that gives this reaſon of their Separation; nor do I believe they would be thought ſuch ſtrict Obſervers of Times and Feſtivals; and it is ſtrange, this ſhould trouble their Conſciences, who care no more for <hi>Eaſter</hi> than they do for <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> but only that it falls upon a Sunday; and if the old obſervance of <hi>Eaſter</hi> in this Country, upon the fourteenth day of the Moon, had continued, we muſt have expected to have had as many Arguments againſt the Feaſt of the Reſurrection, as we have had againſt that of the Nativity.</p>
               <p>After this, he quarrels with ſeveral other Canons of this Council, and at laſt ends in theſe Exclamations, <hi>O brave Pope and Clergy! O patient Council! that ſubſcribed to one man, and pretended to no Judgment. O humble</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine! <hi>that ſubſcribed to all this, and ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and a Womans Subſcription perfecteth all; and O credulous Reader that believeth this!</hi> Why then does he ſpeak ſo modeſtly, that the Fiction is but uncertain? Why does he make Advantage of the number of theſe imaginary Biſhops? Why does he find Fault, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and exclame; if after all, this is but a dream, and his Reader a Fool to believe it?</p>
               <p>Before I cloſe this Chapter, I muſt give an account of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Favourite Sect, the <hi>Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> whom he ſpeaks ſo favourably of, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64435:84"/>as he has occaſion to mention them. The Original of their Schiſm he ſlubbers over, p. 35. after this manner; <hi>And</hi> Novatus, <hi>and</hi> Novatian, <hi>as 'tis ſaid, being againſt their taking</hi> (i. e. the laps'd) <hi>into Communion at all, the Councils excommunicated them all as Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One would imagine by this account, that <hi>Novatus</hi> and <hi>Novatian</hi> had been thruſt out of the Church, and that their Schiſm was an Effect of their Excommunication; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is notorious,<note place="margin">Ep. 39.</note> for <hi>Cyprian</hi> charges <hi>Novatus</hi> with having <hi>firſt departed from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church, and drawn away ſeveral Brethren from the Communion of their Biſhop; and the Reaſon of all this was, his Conſciouſneſs of thoſe horrid Crimes he had committed, which he foreſaw would unavoidably bring the Cenſures of the Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as ſoon as ever the Perſecution was over.</hi> This was the tender Conſcience of the Author of the ancient Sect of the Puritans;<note place="margin">Euſeb. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 43.</note> 
                  <hi>Novatian</hi> in like manner withdrew from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, before he was excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; and the reaſon of his being renounced by the Church, was, becauſe he had firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their Communion: this Phariſaical Saint could not vouchſafe to enter into the ſame Church with Sinners; and if it were not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of all Droſs and Corruption, it muſt be unworthy of his Communion: yet this ſevere Refiner, of all others, had leaſt reaſon to exact this Purity, whoſe Entrance into the Church, as well as the Miniſtry, was by extraordinary Diſpenſation and Indulgence; he was baptized
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64435:84"/>in his bed, in great danger of Death; he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to be confirmed by the Biſhop; he was made Prieſt againſt Eccleſiaſtical Laws [that forbid Clinicks to have any ſhare in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church] by the interceſſion of the Biſhop, who promis'd the People, who were generally againſt his Admiſſion, that this Act ſhould never be drawn into Precedent. Being made Prieſt, he became no great credit to his Friends that promoted him, for in time of Perſecution, being deſired to aſſiſt ſome of the Brethren that were in diſtreſs, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd his Office, and Religion, ſaying, that he would be Prieſt no longer, and had an inclination to betake himſelf to another ſort of Philoſophy than the Chriſtian: this is the man that was ſo rigid and cruel, as not to receive the Repentance of ſuch as had fallen in time of Perſecution, but, inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating himſelf into the good opinion of the Confeſſors, ſuch as had endured the fiery Tryal, he began to bring them into a diſlike of the Church, ſince it did receive thoſe that had abjured that Religion for which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors had ſo gloriouſly ſuffered, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to theſe holy Martyrs in all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Communion. Some of theſe good men were carried away with his diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to do countenance to the Schiſm, and their Authority brought off ſeveral others from the Communion of the Biſhop; but theſe at laſt diſcovering the Wolf in Sheeps clothing, forſook the Impoſtor, and return'd
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64435:85"/>to the Unity of the Church; he, in the mean time, uſes all diligence to widen the breach, and to make it perpetual, by ſetting up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a Biſhop, which then was thought neceſſary to the Being of a Church, although he had ſworn ſolemnly before never to take the Office upon him. To compaſs his Deſign, he ſends ſome of the ſubtileſt of his Agents to three plain ignorant Biſhops, to invite them to <hi>Rome,</hi> under pretence that this wretched Schiſm might be ended by their good Offices: Theſe good men, ſuſpecting no trick, came; and, overcome with his good Entertainment, with too much Wine and Perſwaſion, were forc'd at laſt to lay their hands on him, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate him a Biſhop; and not thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſecure enough yet under this Title, he makes every one of his Congregation engage himſelf by Oath never to forſake him, or to return to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and this in a manner ſo Solemn, that the relation of it is ſufficient to ſtrike a horrour on the mind of the Reader: for when he adminiſtred the Sacrament, after Conſecration, <hi>he made every one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, when the Bread was in his hand, to ſwear to him by the Body and Blood of our Saviour, that they would never forſake him, or return to their former Biſhop.</hi> Theſe were the men, theſe were the means by which the Schiſm of the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> was begun and carried on; a Schiſm no leſs execrable in the Conduct of it, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous in its Authors, and, which is yet worſe than all this, moſt blaſphemous in its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:64435:85"/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is too favourable in his repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Novatian</hi> Doctrine; for, in the place above-cited, he makes theſe two Obſervations in favour of them.

                  <note place="margin">p. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>but only Church-Communion.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That he did not deny this to other great Sinners repenting, but only to thoſe that laps'd to Idolatry, or denying Chriſt; but the</hi> Novatians <hi>long after extended it to other heinous Crimes, as upon ſuppos'd parity of Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt,<note place="margin">lib. 4. c. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> does endeavour to excuſe them, by ſaying, that thoſe who had ſacrificed to Idols in times of Perſecution, were to be exhorted to Repentance, though not to be admitted to Communion, and as to the Pardon of their Sin, they were to leave that to God, who alone has power to forgive Sins.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that <hi>Socrates</hi> is an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian of good credit, and, it ſeems, well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Hiſtory and Doctrine of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> who probably in his time might have grown more moderate in their Opinion concerning Remiſſion of Sin; but nothing can be more evident, than that the Authours of that Schiſm denied not only the Communion of the Church, but God's Pardon, to thoſe who had ſinned after Baptiſm; for this, all the Writers of that time, who muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to underſtand their Tenets, do unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly affirm. <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus,</hi> who lived the ſame time with <hi>Novatian,</hi> and writ
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64435:86"/>to him to adviſe him to return, and be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to the Church, and lay down that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Biſhop, which he pretended was forc'd upon him; this ancient Writer gives us this account of their Doctrine:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Novatian,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>I juſtly abhor, becauſe he has divided the Church, and drawn aſide ſeveral Brethren in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Impiety and Blaſphemy, and brought in a moſt wicked Doctrine concerning God, repreſenting our moſt merciful Saviour as cruel and void of pity: Beſides this, be evacuates holy Baptiſm, and overthrows the Faith that was before him:</hi> And laſtly, <hi>He baniſhes the</hi> Holy Ghoſt <hi>irrevocably from thoſe in whom there is great reaſon to hope that either it Remains ſtill, or may return to them again.</hi> So far <hi>Dionyſius.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THE great Council of <hi>Nice</hi> gives Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s third Chapter;<note place="margin">Ch. Hiſt. p. 45. § 1.</note> He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but the Controverſie about which it was called, was of great Moment, and that it was brought to a happy end, but leſſens, as much as he can, the Credit of the Biſhops, and aſcribes very little to their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Judgment. I do not envy <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Reputation of having heal'd the Differences of the Church, and there is no doubt, but he contributed much to the ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that Controverſie for a while; yet it ſeems he did not judge the Biſhops and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to be of ſo little uſe as Mr. B. would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, but was at great Pains and Expence to bring an extraordinary number of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and he knew no other way of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Differences about Religion, than by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Conſultation of the moſt learned and eminent of thoſe that had the Direction of the Church. Some of theſe indeed had their Grievances to repreſent, and complaints againſt each other; but the Modeſty of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> put an end to their Quarrels and Diſputes, burning all their Accuſations without reading them. It is no wonder, if in ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64435:89"/>aſſembled from all the Provinces of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> World, (conſidering their great Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about Religion) that there ſhould be ſome that might retain the Senſe of Injuries received, and complain of ſuch as had done them wrong; but theſe were but few, and the matter ſoon accommodated.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> adds, <hi>That</hi> Euſebius Nicomed. <hi>and</hi> Arrius <hi>were brought but to counterfeit Repentance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§ 1.</note> 
                  <hi>which ſatisfied</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>though not</hi> Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius; <hi>who, refuſing to receive</hi> Arrius <hi>into Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon</hi> Conſtantine's <hi>Requeſt, cauſed much Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity afterwards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is an oblique Accuſation of that great Champion of the Chriſtian Faith, and ſeems to charge him with all the Calamities which that unhappy Controverſie brought upon the Church: but how juſtly, we will refer to Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s own Words, who calls <hi>Arrius</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, <hi>A counterfeit Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Conſent to the</hi> Nicene <hi>Faith.</hi> If <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaw through this Diſſimulation, why is he yet blamed for not admitting him into the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had ſincerely corrected that Fault for which he was juſtly caſt out?<note place="margin">Socr. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>27.</hi>
                  </note> And it was no hard matter to diſcern the Inſincerity of <hi>Arrius</hi>'s Confeſſion, ſince he diſſembles the very point in Queſtion, and rejects the Terms in which the Council had expreſſed it ſelf: If therefore the good Emperour were impoſed upon by a counterfeit Repentance, and would reſtore that Incendiary to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of doing Miſchief, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64435:89"/>not to be blamed, who wiſely foreſaw what Miſchiefs were like to follow, upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of that Heretick. Compliance with Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, is no likely means to reclaim them; and there is a ſort of Mercy that is more cruel, than Severity: if thoſe few that diſſented from the Determination of that Council, had not been received again without giving great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſecurity of their Faith and Moderation, it might perhaps have ended that fatal Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
               <p>In the next place,<note place="margin">§ 2.</note> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> paſſes to the caſe of the <hi>Meletians,</hi> and thinks it uſeful (for our warning in theſe times) to recite the ſum of the Story out of <hi>Epiphanius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſhort of it is this,<note place="margin">Epiph. Haer. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria,</hi> and <hi>Meletus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lycopolis,</hi> being Fellow-priſoners for the ſame Faith, diſagreed unhappily about the old Queſtion, Whether thoſe that denyed the Faith in time of Perſecution, were to be receiv'd upon their Repentance?</q>
                  <note place="margin">Epiph.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> was for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, <hi>Meletius</hi> for Severity. In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, they divided Congregations in the Priſon, <hi>Peter</hi> ſuffer'd Martyrdom, but the Schiſm ſurvived him, and the Churches of <hi>Aegypt</hi> were upon this occaſion, divided into Parties; <hi>Meletius</hi> is reconciled to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> and lives peaceably with him in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> content with the Title of a Biſhop, but without any exerciſe of his Function. At laſt, the Spirit of Divſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd upon him again, and he made new
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64435:90"/>Ordinations, and ſet Church againſt Church, and Biſhop againſt Biſhop; His Followers after his Death, joyn'd with the <hi>Arrians,</hi> againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and became a great Support to that Hereſie,<note place="margin">p. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>Juſt as if the Nonconformiſts at this time,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>B. ſhould ſeek, by the favour of the Papiſts, to be deliver'd from the ſilencing and deſtroying Prelates, upon Condition of common Liberty; the caſes are not much unlike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not deſire to improve this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to the Reproach of the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> as he endeavours to render Biſhops odious, under the Name of Tyrants; yet I wiſh they would ſeriouſly conſider, what Support their Separation has been to that Faction, they above all men exclame againſt. They have made the Breach, and the Enemy has lodg'd, and fortified himſelf in it, and yet notwithſtanding the common danger that threatens all, ſtill chooſe to purſue their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Scruples and great Animoſities, to the evident hazard of the Reformed Religion, rather than to cloſe with the Church, and to make up the Breaches of our City, which will be impregnable, when it is at Unity in it ſelf. But to return to our Story of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letians.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> confeſſes, page 48. <q>That <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Petavius</hi> ſay that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is deceived in all this Hiſtory, and makes the caſe of the <hi>Meletians,</hi> better than it was, and that ſome <hi>Meletian</hi> Knave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guil'd him. He anſwers, 1. They give us
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64435:90"/>no Proof of any ſuch Knaves beguiling him at all. 2. That he who was ſo apt to overdoe, in ſuſpecting and aggravating Hereſies (<hi>as in</hi> Origen <hi>and</hi> Chryſoſtom<hi>'s Caſe</hi>) was not likely to make the caſe here ſo much better than it was. 3. And how much nearer was <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in Time and Place, than <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Petavius?</hi> And how eaſie was it then for him to have true Notice of ſuch publick things? 4. And if they make <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſo fallacious in ſuch a Story as this, ſo near him, what a ſhake does it give to the Credit of his copious Hiſtory of the many other Hereſies, which he had leſs opportunity to know, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, to the Credit of much of Church-Hiſtory?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has an eaſie way of confuting mens Opinions, without confuting their Reaſons: If he had but mention'd any of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he might have ſpar'd the Labour of his own. As to his firſt Reaſon againſt them, they do not ſtand much upon it, whether a <hi>Meletian</hi> Knave beguil'd <hi>Epiphanius</hi> or no, they prove him to be deceiv'd, and it is likelier he ſhould be deceived by a <hi>Meletian</hi> Knave, than any Body elſe. As to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; No body can think he deſign'd to excuſe the <hi>Meletians,</hi> by that Story which he laid down as he found it. As to the third, it would have ſome weight, if <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Petavius</hi> contradicted this out of their own Heads, without any Authority anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64435:91"/>than <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> Is not <hi>Athanaſius</hi> as credible a Witneſs, who lived in thoſe times, and was concern'd in ſome of thoſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are related by <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation contradicts this. Who then is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who writ a long time after,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Athanaſ.</hi> Apol. 2.</note> or <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> who was witneſs of moſt of theſe things, and muſt needs have heard of that Quarrel in the Priſon, if any ſuch thing had been? But he gives us this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; which, how it can conſiſt with <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>'s, let Mr. <hi>B.</hi> judge: <q>
                     <hi>Peter,</hi> ſays he, was made Biſhop with us before, and ſuffer'd Martyrdom under the Perſecution of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian;</hi> he depos'd, in a Synod of Biſhops, <hi>Meletius</hi> an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Biſhop, convict of many Crimes, and in particular, that he had ſacrificed to Idols; he neither appeal'd to any other Synod, nor took care to purge himſelf before <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſors in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> but made a Schiſm; ſo that his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers now inſtead of Chriſtians, are called <hi>Meletians;</hi> then he began to aſperſe and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate the Biſhops, and <hi>Peter</hi> in the firſt place, then his Succeſſor <hi>Achillas,</hi> and after him <hi>Alexander,</hi> and that with great cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, borrowing the Inſtance of <hi>Abſalon,</hi> to render the Fact of his Depoſition more invidious, and to revenge himſelf by calumniating the innocent.</q> What ſhall we now believe? That <hi>Meletius</hi> who was convict of ſacrificing to Idols himſelf, ſhould be ſo ſevere againſt others that had fallen into the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64435:91"/>ſame Sin? or how ſhould he be impriſon'd for his Religion that had ſacrificed to Idols? This, and the Story of that dividing Mantle, can no more agree, than <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Meletius</hi> could in the Priſon, according to <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Relation. <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> have the ſame Story with <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and not one word of this Partition Mantle. In ſhort, is <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf to be believed againſt <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius?</hi> He is repreſented there as one too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to Sinners, but his Canons are the ſevereſt of any that I have ſeen, and are down-right <hi>Novatianiſm</hi> in Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Opinion: He appoints very long Penance, for Sins not very hainous; and for thoſe that fall away under Perſecution,<note place="margin">Vid. Petr. Alex. Can. ap. Bib. Patr. apud. Synodic. Bever.</note> though their Temptations be never ſo great, and the Terrors of Death never ſo forcible, yet he allows them but juſt Encouragement enough to hope for a Pardon upon their ſincere Repentance; but for ſuch as prevent the danger, and offer themſelves to Sacrifice before the Officers hale them to the Temple,<note place="margin">Petr. Alex. Can. <hi>4.</hi> &amp; Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</note> ſuch were never to be admitted to full Communion, no not at the hour of Death. Is any man like to find fault with this Biſhop for being too indulgent? Is this any great Encouragement to Apoſtates? It would be ſtrange after all this, that men ſhould depart from his Communion, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much proſtituted to the Betrayers of Religion: If all this does not ſatisfie <hi>Mr. B.</hi> but that he will ſtill believe thoſe holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, as unmortified in Priſon, <hi>as the Prieſts
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64435:92"/>and Jeſuits</hi> heretofore were at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> let him enjoy his Fancy, and contempt of ancient Biſhops, and be bound to believe all the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>Epiphanius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> confeſſes, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſeems not to be very accurate in his Diſputes nor his Narratives; why then does he maintain him here againſt the Authority of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and all Senſe and Reaſon? He does acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſome Paſſages in this Hiſtory to be miſtaken; as that the <hi>Meletians</hi> joyned with the <hi>Arrians</hi> before the Death of <hi>Alexander;</hi> and in his Inſtance of the time of <hi>Arrius</hi>'s death, placing it before the Councel of <hi>Nice.</hi> Beſides theſe, there are other Miſtakes no leſs groſs, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſwallows down as true Hiſtory; as firſt, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great baniſh'd <hi>Athanaſius</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he remain'd twelve or fourteen years, till after the Death of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> If <hi>Athanaſius</hi> himſelf be to be believ'd, or <hi>Socrates</hi> out of him, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> baniſh'd him into <hi>Gallia,</hi> and <hi>Treves</hi> was the place where he abode; nor is there any Likelihood that he ſaw <hi>Italy</hi> during his firſt Baniſhment. But the account of the time of it,<note place="margin">Euſeb. de Vit.

               <p>Page 48. §. 4. He gives an account of the Hereſie of <hi>Arrius,</hi> and, I think, heartily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him, if theſe words be his own, <hi>He that denies the Deity of Chriſt, denies his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and he that denies his Eſſence, denies Chriſt, and is no Chriſtian.</hi> Yet he excuſes this Doctrine in compariſon of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and that very juſtly. At laſt, after a ſhort ſum of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Doctrine, he concludes, <hi>this was the dangerous Hereſie of</hi> Arrius. I muſt confeſs, he is ſo much given to Figures, that I can't tell whether he be in earneſt here, or ſpeaks only Ironically; but, ſure I am, that what he ſayes in the next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, is very much to the diſadvantage of the Doctrine of the Trinity: And, to ſay truth, <hi>Petavius</hi> has done it no great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by his Defence of it. 'Tis true, that ſome of the Fathers, before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, ſeem'd to ſpeak ſometimes in favour of that Doctrine, which was afterwards taken up by the <hi>Arrians;</hi> but that they did <hi>cadem ſentire,</hi> is more than ought to be granted.

                  <hi>Dallè</hi> makes the Ancient Fathers to be of little Uſe in the Controverſies between us and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, becauſe (though they may ſeem to favour ſometimes one ſide, ſometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet) they ſpeak looſly, and without any regard to our Controverſies, which were
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64435:94"/>not then in being; Several Paſſages extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Communion with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> were little intended to ſet him up for an infallible Judge; and others, ſpeaking with great Veneration of the Euchariſt, may ſeem to favour Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If any ſuch Opinion had then been in the Church, their words, in probability, had been more deciſive. It is a commendable Charity of Mr. B. to ſay, that <hi>it is enough to believe thoſe Fathers to be ſaved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>though we may not believe them to be without Errour.</hi> Though that Errour, by his confeſſion, is very dangerous, as implying a denial of Chriſt; yet, he adds, <hi>that God is merciful, and requires not knowledge of all alike.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> But, for my part, I believe they do not ſtand in need of that Charity: Some of them ſpoke looſely, in compliance with a Platonick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Trinity, not fore-ſeeing what Conſequences might be drawn from their Expreſſions, or how narrowly they ſhould come afterwards to be examin'd.

Certain it is, that this Council lay under the Imputation of <hi>Arrianiſin,</hi> for when it was objected to <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> that he reſum'd his Place, after that he had been ejected, without the Authority of a Synod to reſtore him, which the Canons of this Council did require; his Defence was, that this was not a Canon of the Church, but of the <hi>Arrians. Sozomen</hi> makes them all
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64435:98"/>
                  <hi>Arrians. The Faction of</hi> Euſebius, (ſaith he) <hi>with ſeveral others that favour'd that Opinion, in all, ninety ſeven Biſhops, aſſembled at</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, <hi>from ſeveral places, under Colour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating a Church; but indeed, as the Event prov'd, to abrogate the Decrees of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council: Athanaſius</hi> rejects them, as ſworn Enemies to him and the Faith, ſo that there is no likely-hood that the majority was Orthodox, ſince <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> had the contriving of this Synod, and by it's means, the Ruine of <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.</hi> But how came this Opinion of thirty ſix only, being <hi>Arrians,</hi> and yet carrying the Cauſe? Some ſay, that they acted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, and did not admit the Orthodox to vote with them; for ſo the Condemnation of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> paſt at <hi>Tyre;</hi> or that they might be impos'd upon by their ſpecious Pretence of diſowning <hi>Arrius;</hi> but becauſe there is no account of any Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Orthodox</hi> in this caſe, no Proteſtation enter'd, (nay, if any ſuch thing had been, it cannot be imagin'd, but that <hi>Sozomen</hi> muſt have mention'd it, where he ſpeaks of the Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> abſenting himſelf on purpoſe, leſt he ſhould be drawn in a ſecond time, to ſubſcribe to the Condemnation of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi>) we muſt conclude. That theſe were all of a Party, and pack'd together upon that deſign. And perhaps, the reading of thirty ſix in <hi>Julius</hi>'s Epiſtle, may be a miſtake of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64435:98"/>it being eaſie to miſtake the <hi>Greek</hi> figure of 90 for 30, unleſs we ſhall judge the contrary to be the true Reading; for the two ancient Latin Tranſlations of <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Exiguus,</hi> and <hi>Iſidorus Mercator,</hi> conclude, <hi>conſenſerunt &amp; ſubſcripſerunt</hi> 30 <hi>Epiſcopi,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Synodical Epiſtle wants but one of juſt thirty Subſcriptions. <hi>Sozomen</hi> mentions another Synod at <hi>Antioch,</hi> of juſt thirty Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and confounds the Acts of it with thoſe of this firſt; but whether it be his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, or the old Tranſlators, that might confound the ſecond with the firſt, I am not able to determine, and the matter is too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to be extricated here.</p>
               <p>Though the Authority of this Council was not great, yet it ſeems the Canons of it were ſo wiſely ſuited to the condition of a diſtracted Church, and to the depreſſing of Schiſm, that they were adopted afterwards by General Councils. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mentions ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, that are moſt of them levell'd againſt Diſſenters, and yet they are ſuch, as the Diſſenters themſelves, that own any Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, cannot find fault with, and when they are in any Power, find neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. The fifth <hi>forbids any Prieſt or Deacons to gather Churches or Aſſemblies againſt the Biſhop's will; and if any did, and did not deſiſt upon admonition, he was to be depoſed; and if he went on, to be oppreſt by the exteriour Power, as ſeditious.</hi> The word <hi>oppreſt,</hi> it ſeems, is Emphatical; and has indeed an old Verſion
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64435:99"/>to favour it; but what may be Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in his ſenſe, with the Council was Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Puniſhment; and the <hi>Greek</hi> word it uſes ſignifies not ſo much the Penalty, as the End for which it was to be inflicted, the <hi>reduction</hi> of Schiſmaticks.<note place="margin">

               <p>The reſt of the Councils, to the end of this Chapter, muſt be confeſs'd not to be much to the Honour of the Church; yet the evil Effects and Conſequences of them, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be charged upon the <hi>Arrian</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

               <p>The account which <hi>Hillary</hi> gives of thoſe times is very ſad, but yet, ſuch as ſhews, rather the Calamity than the fault of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, every one, as in time of an irreſiſtable Conflagration, uſing his beſt, though ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Endeavour, to quench the Flames.

               <p>IT was a malicious Suggeſtion of the Devil againſt <hi>Job,</hi> when he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to lay to his Charge, to call his Integrity in Queſtion, <hi>Does</hi> Job <hi>ſerve God for nought?</hi> And Mr. <hi>B.</hi> though he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where abhors <hi>Diaboliſme,</hi> yet here, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to the odious Arts of the Accuſer of the Brethren, and endeavours to diſparage the Faith and Orthodoxneſs of the Biſhops of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> by inſinuating, that it was but their Compliance with good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: <hi>The Biſhops</hi> (ſays he) <hi>much follow'd the Emperours Will:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 65. § 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and if the Faith of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine <hi>Senior</hi> and <hi>Junior,</hi> Conſtans, Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian, <hi>had not fail'd, the General Councils at</hi> Milan <hi>and</hi> Ariminum, <hi>tell us how failing the Biſhops Faith was like to be.</hi> What can there be more unchriſtian, than this Suggeſtion? Why could not the Biſhops Faith be as ſincere and conſtant as the Emperours? Nay, that theſe Emperours did continue Orthodox, muſt be in great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure aſcrib'd to the Diligence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, that had any Influence upon them. <q>But it ſeems, the Emperours drew Councils on their part, what ſide ſoever they took; And what wonder, ſince they could call whom they pleas'd, and pack
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64435:101"/>their Councils, diſable thoſe that were not for their Turn, turn honeſt men out of their Biſhopricks, with a high hand, and put into their places, ſuch as were fitteſt for their purpoſe.</q> By the ſame means, <hi>England</hi> became <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> as the World became <hi>Arrian,</hi> and yet I hope Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not charge the Biſhops with too much Compliance in that Particular: Nay,<note place="margin">§ 2.</note> in the very next Paragraph, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does the Biſhops Right again, and ſhews, without thinking of doing them any Juſtice, how they were not ſo complying as he repreſented them before; for he tells us, <hi>That eighty were burn'd by</hi> Valens <hi>in one Ship, and in all the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>he Depos'd, Abus'd, Murder'd many that would not forſake the</hi> Nicene <hi>Creed; and then deſcends to more Particulars of the</hi> Arrian <hi>Perſecution.</hi> And now the Reader may ceaſe to wonder, if he find numerous Councils in ſo ſhort a time, contradicting one the other; ſince good Biſhops are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, depos'd, or murder'd, and Hereticks forc'd upon their Churches.

P.</hi> and his chief deſign in it,<note place="margin">1 Carm. de vita ſua.</note> was, to reconcile, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, theſe Differences, which were occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by Hereticks, who envy'd the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Biſhops, and had a violent Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their Chairs. However, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will have it, <hi>That he ſpake all this and a great deal more of this Council of</hi> C. P. <hi>one of the four which is equall'd to the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts.</hi> He does indeed in ſeveral places find fault with this Council, but is far from making ſuch a Riot as this; and, it ſeems, he had a great many Friends in it, as appears by their Diſſention con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, which he put an end to, by a voluntary Reſignation of his Place: and it is evident from his own Account, that the Council had not agreed upon his Depoſition till after his Reſignation;<note place="margin">Carm. de vita ſua.</note>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:64435:105"/>for, after his Speech, he ſays, That a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Murmur follow'd, and the younger men brought the old over, I ſuppoſe, to accept of this Offer, that ſince his Caſe did give ſome occaſion of Diſſention, the prudenteſt way was to take him at his Word, and ſo end the Quarrel.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems, <hi>Gregory</hi> did reſent the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and did not bear the Deprivation of his Biſhoprick, with the ſame Generoſity he propos'd, which made him a little more ſharp than was decent, in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Biſhops; but from hence to conclude againſt the Biſhops, as the Diſturbers of all the World, would argue as little Judgment as it would Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for Orators draw ſomething bigger than the Life, and Satyriſts love to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. The Age, though wicked enough, may not be as wicked as a zealous Preacher might repreſent it; all men are Lyars, ſays <hi>David</hi> in his Haſte; and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was neglected by his own Friends, concluded generally, All ſeek their own, and not the things that are Chriſt's; and what wonder, if this holy man, ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd with Diſcontent, ſhould exclame, with ſomewhat too great a Paſſion, againſt the Adminiſtration of the Church, which he had been forc'd to quit. His Cenſure of Councils, that he knew none of them have any happy End, was not the fault of the Expedient for ending of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64435:106"/>Differences, but of the men, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, of the Hereticks, that were upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt moſt part of his time, for he does frequently profeſs a great Veneration for the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and was one of the greateſt Champions for it in his time.</p>

The Expedient ſo extraordinary, ſhew'd the Moderation that was us'd to end the firſt Schiſm: but <hi>Flavianus</hi> can have no excuſe, who, againſt the Canons, and the Intereſt and Peace of the Church, and againſt his own Oath, ſet up himſelf againſt his lawful Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Obſervation is, <hi>That even good Biſhops cannot agree, nor eſcape the Imputation of Hereſie;</hi> which refers to <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus.</hi> It is much to be lamented, that good men cannot rightly underſtand one another, but ſo it has ever been, and the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had miſunderſtandings; but this is

How far the Hiſtorian is to be credited in theſe marvellous Relations of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> I am as loth to determine as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> but ſure it is, that, all things confider'd, though St. <hi>Martin</hi> may paſs for a great Saint, yet ſeveral of his actions ſhew more Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Zeal, than Knowledge or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; for, though it were much to his credit to be ſollicited to an Emperour's Table,<note place="margin">Sever.</note> yet it was a great want of Duty to prefer his own Prieſt to the Emperour and Nobles, in outward expreſſions of reſpect: and, though it was great Devotion in the Empreſs to condeſcend to be his Cook
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64435:108"/>and Serving-maid, yet it was no great ſign of Humility in him to accept the ſervice. For my part, I muſt confeſs, I ſhould be very loth to ſeparate from the Communion of a Church, whoſe Doctrines I could not except againſt, merely upon this Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and the Example and Miracles of St. <hi>Martin.</hi>

               <p>The next thing, worth Reflection, is, his Remark upon the Council of <hi>Capua:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>This Council</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>had more wit than many others, and order'd, that both Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi> Flavian<hi>'s and</hi> Evagriu<hi>'s, being all good Chriſtians, ſhould live in loving Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: O that others had been as wiſe, in not believing the Prelates that perſwaded the World, that it is ſo pernicious a thing for two Churches and Biſhops to be in one City, as</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>are ſaid to be at</hi> Rome.] Whatever <hi>Wit</hi> this Council had, it ſeems Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſhews little, in miſtaking it ſo groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for the Council of <hi>Capua</hi> never order'd that the two oppoſite Biſhops and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations at <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſhould joyn in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Communion; but only that the Eaſtern Biſhops, that had divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon that occaſion, ſome taking part with <hi>Flavianus,</hi> others with <hi>Evagrius,</hi>

                  <hi>a Hereſie raiſed by one that was no Biſhop: but the beſt is, it was but a lit-Hereſie; that of</hi> Jovinian.] But how! is it ſo ſtrange a thing that a Hereſie ſhould be raiſed by one that is no Biſhop? or did he not turn Heretick becauſe he was
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64435:109"/>not made one? <hi>Cerinthus, Ebion, Marcion, Valentinus, Artemon, Arrius,</hi> &amp;c. were they Biſhops?

               <p>
                  <hi>It is ſtrange</hi> (ſayes Mr. <hi>B.</hi>) <hi>that</hi> Binnius <hi>vouchſafes next,</hi>

But, let Mr. <hi>B.</hi> enjoy his wonder, when he is in the fit, he muſt give others leave to wonder a little too, at the Tranſports of a man that pretends ſo much to moderation <hi>[that would ſay, as loud as I can ſpeak, if all the proud, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, hereticating part of the Biſhops had been of this mind; O, what Sin,</hi>

               <p>There is ſome Difference between the Sum in groſs, and the Particulars, which will not agree, though you ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the twelve vacant Sees, for then the Particulars will not come up to the Sum of four hundred ſixty ſix: And now judge, whether the <hi>African</hi> Biſhopricks were not bigger than our Pariſhes, by comparing the vaſt Extent of <hi>Africk,</hi> with our <hi>England,</hi> which is not near ſo big as ſome of thoſe Provinces: and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64435:112"/>yet the Biſhopricks of <hi>Africk</hi> were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd thus occaſionally, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter, and cannot preſcribe to other Countreys: Nor could the Churches of <hi>Africk,</hi> notwithſtanding the Multitude of their Biſhops, and Narrowneſs of their Dioceſes, keep themſelves in Peace any more than their Neighbours, but were divided as ſoon as any, and their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were as long and irremediable as their Neighbours; And indeed, Schiſm came over from hence into the other parts of the World with <hi>Novatus,</hi> and who taught the <hi>Roman</hi> Presbyters firſt, to ſet up againſt their Biſhops. In ſhort, there was no where a greater Breach, nor more extravagant Schiſmaticks, who oppos'd themſelves, not only againſt the Diſcipline of the Church, but the Civil Government too. Now, leſt this may put our Author out of Conceit with the Biſhops and Councils of <hi>Africk,</hi> as well as the reſt; I muſt put him in mind of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, <hi>That good men will do well,</hi> whether they be Biſhops or not, whether they have large or ſmall Dioceſes, and a very good man in a very great Dioceſs, will do an extraordinary deal of good.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64435:114"/>this is particularly noted in the Margin for, it may be, that he may have a great Paſſion to have this Canon executed. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy is a Paſſion, may ſlay the ſilly one, but it is much more comfortable, to be the Object of his Envy than Contempt. There are others that order the Biſhops, <hi>to regard the Presbyters as his Brethren,</hi> and they are much to blame, that do not; but there are others innumerable, that command the Presbyters to obſerve their Biſhops as their Governours, as their Fathers, as the Vicegerents of Chriſt. 52. is ſomething odd, and ſhews the Poverty of the <hi>African</hi> Church, that a Clerk, or Clergy-man, how learned ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in God's Word, muſt get his Living by a Trade; this is contrary to the uſage of all other Churches, even in their loweſt times, and to the third Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Can. 15.</note> which forbids it. <q>Item pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit ut Epiſcopi &amp; Presbyteri, &amp; Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coni, vel Clerici non ſint conductores neque procuratores, neque ullo turpi vel in honeſto negotio victum quaerant, quia reſpicere debeant ſcriptum eſſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo militans.</q> Deo implicat ſe negotiis ſaecularibus.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64435:116"/>the Biſhop: He comes out to them, and endeavours to appeaſe the Tumult, by ſaying, <hi>I ſee you as the Face of God:</hi> This ſaying did a little aſſwage the Tumult, and the Monks, having abated ſomething of their rage, reply'd, If thou think'ſt as thou ſpeakeſt, condemn <hi>Origen</hi>'s Books, that teach men to think otherwiſe of God. This, reply'd <hi>Theophilus,</hi> I intended to do long ago, and moſt willingly comply with you in; for I diſlike <hi>Origen</hi>'s Opinions no leſs than you.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64435:118"/>to re-imburſe the Biſhop what he laid out upon the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Churches, ſaying, That it it was far better to refreſh the Bodies of the Poor, for whom that Treaſure was intended, and which were properly the Temples of God, than to lay it out upon the building of Churches: But, whether it were for theſe, or for other reaſons, ſo it was, that <hi>Iſidore</hi> was excommunicated, and came to <hi>Scetis,</hi> to his old Friends the Monks. <hi>Ammonius,</hi> taking ſome of them along with him, goes to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus,</hi> and deſires him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd to <hi>Iſidore,</hi> which, he is ſaid then readily to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd; but, after ſome time, when nothing was done, and they ſaw plainly that <hi>Theophilus</hi> did intend to put them off, they come again, and renew the Requeſt, with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er earneſtneſs, requiring a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Promiſe: He takes one of the Monks, and puts him in the common Priſon, for a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to the reſt; but this would

               <p>Now, if we examine theſe Relations im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, we may obſerve ſeveral things that are very improbable, almoſt impoſſible, to conceive. All theſe men that are ſaid to be perſecuted unjuſtly by <hi>Theophilus,</hi> were ſuch as he had an Extraordinary kindneſs for; and therefore it is not very likely, without ſpecial Provocation, he ſhould ever endeavour to ruine thoſe he took ſo much pains to ſet up: And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the Story of <hi>Iſidore,</hi> it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improbable; for this was the man he oppoſed to <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> as Competitor for the Biſhoprick of <hi>C. P.</hi> This was he that was intruſted with the great Secret, upon which his Life and Dignity did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend; he that had receiv'd double Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Letters to preſent him that ſhould overcome, whether <hi>Theodoſius</hi> or <hi>Maximus;</hi> And, is it likely, he ſhould fall out with this man ſo deſperately about a <hi>punctilio</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling a Heretick Woman? or witneſſing that himſelf muſt know not to be truth?
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64435:120"/>Is it likely a Perſon ſo Eminent in Place and Reputation, of an extraordinary For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune too, ſhould ſuborn two the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable men in the Church of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> to forſwear themſelves in favour of his Siſter? Surely, he muſt know them too well, after ſo long an acquaintance and experience, to hazard his Reputation upon ſo unlikely a Project, He muſt know them to be very Evil men, before he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt them in that nature; nor is it very likely, that <hi>Iſidore,</hi> conſidering his Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> ſhould have refus'd him any Money to carry on and ſupport his Magnificence in Publick Buildings.</p>
               <p>However, ſuppoſe all this true, they muſt be only private Reaſons, ſuch as <hi>Theophilus</hi> kept ſecret to himſelf; but he muſt find ſome other plauſible Pretence to juſtifie his Excommunication of theſe perſons that were ſo conſiderable in their Place, and Reputation in the World: He could not be ſo brutiſh, as to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a man, becauſe he would not forſwear himſelf, or rob the Poor to ſerve him. There muſt be ſomething for a Colour, and that theſe <hi>Impartial, Credible</hi> Hiſtorians, did both forget; for I ſuppoſe, the Monks from whom they had this Relation, did not care much to inſiſt upon that point, which would make a man ſuſpect, that <hi>Theophilus</hi> his Cauſe might be ſomething juſtifiable; and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64435:120"/>ſurely, it was very plauſible, when all the World in a manner, did approve it. Thus every Malefactor will give out, that he is perſecuted out of Envy and Malice, and ſuch a one they had diſobliged in this manner, and another became their Enemy upon another Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but not a word of the Crimes laid to their Charge, or of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt them. No poor men, though they talk'd Sedition or Treaſon, blaſphem'd God or the King, and the Fact be notorious, yet they fall innocent Victims to the Malice or Covetouſneſs of their Judges.</p>

                     </note> we came to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where there was a foul Contention between the Biſhops and the Monks, about the Books of <hi>Origen,</hi> thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and forbidding the reading of them, becauſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangerous Errors contain'd in them; the other Party char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this upon the Hereticks that had corrupted the Works of <hi>Origen.</hi> The Contention in ſhort, grew very high, and the Biſhops according to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they had, forbid all, good and bad, becauſe there were Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Writers enough, that might be read with as much Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and much leſs Danger;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64435:122"/>and then inſtanc'd in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Origen,</hi> that were very extravagant; but this could not ſatisfie the Favourers of <hi>Origen,</hi> who began to be in an Uproar, which when the Authority of the Biſhops could not appeaſe, the Civil Magiſtrate is forc'd to take the Church-Diſcipline into his own hands, <hi>Saevo Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo,</hi> ſays the Author. Upon this, the Monks were terrified, and made their Eſcape whither they could, and the Edicts of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates purſued them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This perſon it ſeems, was no Favourer of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and yet there is nothing he finds fault with, but the too great Rigour, and the taking of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſupply the defect of Church-Diſcipline: yet it ſeems, there was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity for it, for theſe Monks had mutiny'd, and rais'd a Sedition, and then ſurely, it is time for the Magiſtrate to look about him. 2. The ſame Hiſtorian repreſents this not as any ſudden ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Oppreſſion of the Origeniſts; for he mentions ſeveral Synods that had been aſſembled for this purpoſe. 3. He
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64435:123"/>does not make this the Effect of any particular Quarrel between the Monks and <hi>Theophilus,</hi> but makes the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie to be between the Monks and the Biſhops; and which of them had moſt right to govern the Church, and appoint what Books were, or were not fit to be read?</p>
               <p>But to return to our Author, he tells us farther,<note place="margin">Sever.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Biſhop of that place en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd him very courteouſly, and beyond what he could have expected; he made him a kind Invitation, that he would ſtay, and live with him, but that he refus'd, thinking it not fit to ſtay in a place, <hi>ubi fraterna Cladis tam recens fervebat invidia.</hi> Then he adds, That though the Monks ought likely to have obey'd the Biſhops, yet, on the other ſide, they ought not to have us'd ſo great a Rigor.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here is not a word of <hi>Theophilus</hi> his Crimes, which he would not have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, having ſo fair an Occaſion to mention to mention them, and they would have been very proper Reaſons for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal to ſtay at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and would
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64435:123"/>have very much aggravated the Envy of perſecuting thoſe Monks:<note place="margin">Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</note> But here is not a word of <hi>Him,</hi> which the other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are not as nearly concern'd in as himſelf: and laſtly, here is a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of that pretty Story of <hi>Socrates,</hi> That the <hi>Origeniſts</hi> were perſecuted for believing God to be incorporeal; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, they were the Errors of <hi>Origen,</hi> as that Chriſt had dyed to ſave the Devils and ſuch like; that the Biſhops object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And, to ſay Truth, that was a pretty Suggeſtion, that they ſhould be call'd <hi>Origeniſts</hi> for holding God incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal. Was <hi>Origen</hi> ſingular in that point? Did not every one that ever had any Reaſon with his Senſe teach the ſame thing? And therefore the other Story of the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> urging <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> to condemn <hi>Origen</hi> upon the ſame Account, comes under the ſame Suſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, by the ſame Reaſon, they muſt have forc'd him to condemn all the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Writers in the World. Yet ſuch was the Impudence of theſe muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Monks, that they were not aſham'd to tell it all the World, that all thoſe that were againſt them, were <hi>Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphites;</hi>

I do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to excuſe <hi>Theophilus</hi> in this Particular, he did certainly proſecute his Reſentment too far, but he was not the only man, <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> a perſon of great Holineſs, <hi>Hierom,</hi> and ſeveral other perſons, renoun'd for their Piety, were concern'd in the perſecution of this great man, as well as he: and ſo it is that the beſt men have their Reſentments and Piques, as well as others; and to ſay the Truth, this is their Weakneſs, for that Severity which gives men generally a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Holineſs, tho it mortifie ſome irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular heats, yet is apt to diſpoſe men to Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs; and what kills ſome Weeds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Nouriſhment to others.</p>
               <p>I have dwelt ſo long upon this, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vindicate <hi>Theophilus,</hi> but to ſhew (once for all) the manner of our Author's dealing with his Reader in his Church-Hiſtory.

No ſuch thing; they might them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deliver the Offender, if they judg'd him unworthy of Mercy; all they deſir'd was, that they ſhould not be forc'd away, or elſe their Sanctuary was no more ſo. It is a hard thing to pleaſe a man that has ſuch contrary Humours.

               <p>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> makes it part of his charge that he took upon him the government of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral affairs,<note place="margin">Socr. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64435:128"/>was not the uſurpation of the Biſhop but the indulgence of the Emperour; and the Truth is, that the Church and State being now united, and the Schiſms of the one cauſing inevitable ſeditions in the other, the Civil Magiſtrates for the greater ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Government did think it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to inveſt the Biſhop with a coercive power, ſince their Spiritual authority was contemn'd to the diſhonour of Religion, and no leſs to the diſturbance of the State. And it was it ſeems a crime in <hi>Cyril</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Commiſſion, or to act in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it: though our Author elſewhere profeſſes that he ſhall <hi>not diſhonour ſuch,</hi>

                  <q>But beſides the ſuppreſſing of the <hi>Novatian</hi> Conventicles, he is charged with executing ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> and baniſhing others, which <hi>Oreſtes</hi> took ill, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon his office, who was Governour of the Province.<note place="margin">Socr. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> But as to this he cannot be very much blamed, for the <hi>Jews</hi> conſpired againſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and reſolved to deſtroy them all in one night; they gave the alarm that one of their Churches was on fire, and as the Chriſtians ran out to quench the fire, they were murdred by thoſe Villains. Perhaps <hi>Cyril</hi> did not think this a time to complement the Governour to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Chriſtians, when the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they were in was ſufficient to call him away, but animated the people to make their defence, and to go in queſt of theſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64435:128"/>Murderers; and it was a ſign of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that there were but ſome execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that all were not put to the Sword, after ſo barbarous an attempt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This or ſomething elſe offended the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,<note place="margin">Socr. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>14.</hi>
                     </note> ſo that he became irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>Cyril.</hi> The Biſhop like a good man, endeavoured by all means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a reconciliation, but without effect;</q> and why is a Biſhop to be worſe thought of, if a man of quality become his implacable enemy without cauſe? Five hundred Monks came from Mount <hi>Nitria</hi> in a fit of wild zeal to take the Biſhops part; and <hi>Socrates</hi> cannot ſay that he ſent for them, they light on the governour and aſſault him; he is wounded, and hardly eſcapes with life: But how could <hi>Cyril</hi> help this? or how can he be charg'd with the extravagance of thoſe Monks that he had no knowledge of till they had committed it? But one of thoſe Mutineers (ſays <hi>Socrates</hi>) that wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the governour being executed for his crime, was honour'd by <hi>Cyrill</hi> as a Martyr; I do very much ſuſpect this ſtory, from the circumſtance of changing the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals name to <hi>Thaumaſius,</hi> and the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable conjecture that I can make of it, if there be any ground at all for the ſtory, is, that the memory of a Martyr of that name might be honoured by him, which his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies interpreted to be the Criminal. But this changing of name is a thing without precedent, and without reaſon; for either
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64435:129"/>this diſguiſe was put on that it might not be obſerv'd, and he was aſhamed of doing it openly; and then it will not be eaſie to be certain that this <hi>Thaumaſius</hi> was that <hi>Ammonius</hi> who was executed: or if he was the ſame, and <hi>Cyril</hi> confeſt it, then it is impoſſible to imagine a reaſon why he ſhould uſe that diſguiſe. But there are men in the world that honour ſuch as Martyrs that were executed, not for Wounding a Governour, but Murdering a King after a moſt unexampled manner; witneſs the worthy Martyrologies of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,</hi>

               <p>Another thing which our Author cites from the profeſſed enemies of <hi>Cyril</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him odious, was the Murder of <hi>Hypa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> the famous She-Philoſopher; She it ſeems was barbarouſly murder'd, but by whom, or upon what occaſion is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. <hi>Socrates</hi> makes the occaſion to have been this,<note place="margin">Socr. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> That ſhe being frequently with the Governour was ſuſpected to do <hi>Cyril</hi> evil offices, and to diſſwade the Governour from being reconciled to him, therefore ſome Zealots watched her, and barbarouſly
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64435:129"/>Murder'd her, among whom was one <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> a Reader of the Church, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of <hi>Cyril.</hi> And this (continues the ſame Hiſtorian) brought a great reproach upon <hi>Cyril</hi> and the Church of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>] But he cannot charge the Biſhop of being by any means conſcious to it: and though it were done upon his account by violent heady Zealots; yet he could be no further guilty than he contributed to it, by his countenance or conſent.<note place="margin">Suidas in Damaſcius.</note> 
                  <hi>Damaſcius</hi> in the life of <hi>Iſidore</hi> the Husband of this <hi>Hypatia</hi> charges <hi>Cyril</hi> directly with this Murder; but his credit ſignifies very little, as being in the firſt place a Heathen, and a violent enemy of the Chriſtians; and ſecondly, being more remote from theſe times, for he liv'd in the reign of <hi>Juſtinian;</hi>

                  <hi>Valeſius</hi> cites the paſſage at large out of him, and promiſes to publiſh much more of him than we have had hitherto: This is taken out of <hi>Suidas,</hi> who I believe cites the whole out of this Author: In the beginning he makes it dubious who were the Authors of the death of <hi>Hypatia, Some</hi> (ſays he) <hi>faſten it upon</hi> Cyril, <hi>others upon the</hi> Alexandrians, <hi>the moſt ſeditious of all mankind: as may be ſeen by their murdering ſome of their own Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops;</hi> all which I ſuppoſe are the words of this <hi>Damaſcius:</hi> Then he goes on to give a more particular account of this Woman; and makes <hi>Cyril</hi> to conceive this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy againſt her, becauſe <hi>on a certain time paſſing by her houſe, and ſeeing what great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64435:130"/>there was to her, and what a number of Coaches were at her door, he reſolved to make her away.</hi> This whole ſtory is altogether improbable, for <hi>Hypatia</hi> was an <hi>Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> born and bred, and ſo publickly known, that <hi>Cyril</hi> who was bred in the ſame place could not be ſo great a ſtranger to her as that ſtory makes him to be after he was a Biſhop. He could not be ignorant of her or her School, without being the greateſt ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in <hi>Alexandria:</hi> In ſhort, this is no other than a calumny invented by this <hi>Damaſcius</hi> to render the Chriſtians odious, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to do upon all occaſions, as <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> tells us.<note place="margin">Bibliothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, l. <hi>180.</hi>

               <p>After this, to render <hi>Cyril</hi> more odious yet, <hi>our Author reproaches him with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy quarrel with</hi> Chryſoſtome,<note place="margin">

This was a fault, and he that is without any, or without any particular animoſity, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he be in any eminent place, let him
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64435:130"/>caſt the firſt ſtone. But our Author does charge him with ſome things injuriouſly, as his calling <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that perſwaded <hi>Atticus</hi> to reſtore <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms</hi> name, a bold-fac'd man; the word (though us'd by <hi>Cyril</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>) is indeed the expreſſion of <hi>Atticus</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Cyril,</hi> and therefore if there be any indecency in it, it's to be imputed to the firſt Author: But however <hi>Cyril</hi> had behaved himſelf in this affair, it is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle unchriſtian to blaſt his memory with thoſe faults he had corrected in his life time; for though our Author affirms, that no credible Hiſtorian tells us that either <hi>Theophilus</hi> or <hi>Cyril</hi> ever repented of this: yet I believe there is ſufficient evidence to the contrary to perſwade any reaſonable man. For beſides that <hi>Socrates</hi> affirms <hi>Theophilus</hi> before his death to have been reconcil'd to thoſe Monks, upon whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he had quarrel'd with <hi>Chryſoſtome, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils</hi> Letter to <hi>Gennadius</hi> ſhews him to have been ſatisfy'd in the buſineſs of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s Honourable Reſtauration to the Diptychs. <q>
                     <hi>Gennadius</hi> was a Presbyter of the Church of <hi>C.

The fiction of <hi>Nicephorus</hi> about <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Viſion was (I ſuppoſe) invented to ſalve the reputation of <hi>Cyril.</hi> For ſince after ſo great oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he chang'd his mind; to remove from him the imputation of levity, and to ſhew that he was carry'd away ſincerely, and by an invincible miſtake, he muſt be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a miracle.</p>

               <p>However it were, whether <hi>Cyril</hi> repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this fault or no, our Author cannot forbear exclaiming, upon the occaſion of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s reſtoring the name of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> by the authority of a Synod. <hi>O ductile Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods!

Surely our Author cannot pretend to exempt himſelf from the laſh of his own exclamations; for I know no man deeper engag'd in the contentions of the Church, or that has writ with greater bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs on all ſuch occaſions: The writing of a great part of his 80 books being but like ſo many pitch'd battels he has fought, and moſt commonly in the dark, when he was hardly able to diſcover friend from foe: if he ſcorns to be ſo <hi>ductile</hi> as theſe <hi>Synods,</hi> and to recant his miſtakes when they are diſcover'd to him, I pray God give him a better mind, and make him to have a more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable opinion of repentance.</p>

               <p>But <hi>Theodoret</hi> it ſeems was never truly reconcil'd to him: for in his Epiſtle to <hi>Johannes Antioch.</hi> he looks upon the death of <hi>Cyril</hi> as <hi>a deliverance of the Church from a turbulent enemy of Peace.

               <p>I have been more particular in the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of this great Biſhop from thoſe calumnies our Author raked out of all the Libels of his Enemies, becauſe all this ſeems to be brought in on purpoſe to leſſen the reputation of the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that was chiefly directed by the authority of <hi>Cyril;</hi> and that you may not take this for an uncertain conjecture of his deſign he explains himſelf [<hi>But (pardon truth or be deceived ſtill) ignorance and pride,</hi>

Or how can that be the effect of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Envy or Ambition, which he himſelf did endeavour to prevent by all the amicable methods ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; as may be ſeen by his Letters to <hi>Neſtorius?</hi> But if the Reader will not blindly engage in all the groundleſs jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and malicious ſuggeſtions of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, then he has much ado to forbear cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him Fool; but however he diſmiſſes him with that which is equivalent, <hi>Let him

               <p>Before we enter upon the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> it is fit ſome notice ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of our Authors account of <hi>Neſtorius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The worſt thing he can ſay of him is, <hi>That he was hot againſt Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the aſſiſtance of the Civil Magiſtrate to ſuppreſs them; that he went about to pull down the Church of the</hi> Arians, <hi>and they ſet it on fire themſelves,</hi> and then call'd him <hi>Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand,</hi> when themſelves were the Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; he <hi>vex'd the Novatians,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64435:135"/>although Biſhops and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are ſo abominable in his ſight. But enough of this, for our purpoſe: I will leave our Author to the judgement of his Brethren, and only crave the Readers Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for this digreſſion.</p>
               <p>We are now come to the Council of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> which was occaſion'd by <hi>Neſtorius</hi> his denying the Bleſſed Virgin to be the Mother of that perſon that was God: this doctrine was broach'd by his favourite, Prieſt <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius;</hi> though <hi>Neſtorius</hi> being the more eminent perſon carry'd away the name and reputation of it: Our Author ſays, This ſet all the City in a diviſion, diſputing of they well knew not what: <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was ſuſpected by ſome to deny the Godhead of Chriſt, <hi>but he was of no ſuch opinion,]</hi> It is true, he did not <hi>directly</hi> deny the Godhead of Chriſt but <hi>conſequentially</hi> he did, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>The Emperour weary of this ſtir,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 89. <hi>ſect.</hi> 9.</note> calls a Council; and yet our Author forgets himſelf not many pages after, where he will have his Reader believe that <hi>Cyril</hi> made all this ſtir to pleaſe the Court.</p>
               <p>The truth of it is, the obſtinacy of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius</hi> oblig'd the Emperour to aſſemble this Council; for <hi>Cyril</hi> had try'd all the moderate ways in the world to reclaim him before this was thought of. Nothing can be more modeſt than <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ep. ad Neſt.</note> though he had receiv'd ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal provocations from him; and after
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64435:135"/>this another written with the ſame Spirit;<note place="margin">Secunda Ep. ad Neſt.</note> but <hi>Neſtorius</hi> took all this brotherly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition for reproach, and endeavour'd to maintain his opinion, and to ſecure himſelf in equivocal and doubtful expreſſions, ſometimes ſeeming to ſpeak the ſame thing with <hi>Cyril,</hi> that Chriſt had <hi>two natures</hi> in <hi>one perſon,</hi> ſometimes conſidering Chriſt as a <hi>double perſon,</hi> and always denying <hi>Mary</hi> to be the <hi>Mother of God</hi> by any means: This was the unhappy Controverſie that divided the world. Several being deceiv'd by the Equivocations of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> took his part at firſt, but finding him obſtinate in denying the Virgin to be the Mother of that perſon that was God, they at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted him, and joyn'd with <hi>Cyril</hi> in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
               <p>It had been happy for the Church if the myſteries of our Religion had never been curiouſly diſputed. But when buſie, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome men have ſtarted a new dangerous doctrine, and endeavour to propagate it with all induſtry imaginable, it is not fit that the Governours ſhould ſit as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd Spectators, but that they ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vigorouſly all ſuch remedies as God has put into their hands: <hi>i. e.</hi> adviſe, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, rebuke; and if theſe means prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual to ſtop the courſe of evil doctrine, they muſt proceed according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles advice, <hi>a Heretick after admonition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> This method therefore of proceeding againſt Hereſies and the Authors of them
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64435:136"/>cannot be diſallowed by any reaſonable man. But this caſe of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> it ſeems yields a further debate; and the merit of the cauſe is yet diſputed. <hi>Derodon</hi> makes <hi>Neſtorius</hi> Orthodox, and <hi>Cyril</hi> the Heretick: our Author believes both Orthodox, but that they did not underſtand one another; and <hi>ſo by words that themſelves did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, they ſet all the world on fire.</hi> As for <hi>Derodon,</hi> he manifeſtly condemns <hi>Neſtorius</hi> in a little Treatiſe <hi>De Suppoſito,</hi> printed with ſeveral other Philoſophical Tracts of his; and approves <hi>Cyril:</hi> the truth is, he has a ſingular notion of a perſon there which ſeems to approach <hi>Neſtorianiſm,</hi> which he endeavours to confirm by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Cyril</hi> and other Fathers: but this which our Author cites, I have not yet ſeen, nor can I find that it has been yet publiſh'd; however ſince the minutes of his arguments are ſet down by our Author, I will endeavour to ſhew the miſtake of that learned man, by giving the true ſtate of the queſtion between <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neſtorius</hi> did firſt recede from the allow'd expreſſions of the Fathers, who did all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally call the Bleſſed Virgin the Mother of God; and therefore was juſtly ſuſpected to recede from their doctrine: <hi>Cyril</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes him of this dangerous innovation, and explains himſelf concerning the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſon of God; <hi>Neſtorius</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to confute it; and now let us ſee
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64435:136"/>what it was that they both maintain'd. I will begin with the Doctrine of <hi>Cyril,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>i. e.</hi> diſtinct natures concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to make a real Unity; of both which conſiſts one Chriſt and one Son: not that the difference of the natures are taken away by that Unity, but that the divinity and humanity combin'd by an unſpeakable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Union, make one Chriſt, and one Son.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, uniting the manhood hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically to himſelf: and as to the order of this Union he explains himſelf farther, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>i. e.</hi> He was not firſt a meer man that was born of the Holy Virgin; which the Divinity afterwards did aſſume; but the <hi>Word</hi> being united to the <hi>Man</hi> from the very Womb, is ſaid to have undergone a carnal generation. And that this Union does not deſtroy the difference of natures in Chriſt, he ſhews expreſly in that ſame place, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64435:137"/>He became man, but did not therefore ceaſe to be God, but after the aſſumption of Fleſh, remain'd ſtill the ſame that he was before. And to the ſame purpoſe in another place, <hi>after the aſſumption of Fleſh he remain'd very God,</hi>

                  <hi>I muſt needs confeſs, for they are different things that are ſignify'd by theſe two names, as to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards their eſſence, and have nothing the one like the other, and</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Ep. ad Neſt.</note>] and laſtly he ſhews the abſurdity of rejecting this <hi>Hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> as <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible;</hi> becauſe it will unavoidably force us to allow two Sons; the Son of Man: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by himſelf: and the Son of God again by himſelf, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which he plainly confutes. If this does not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare two natures ſubſiſting in one perſon, it is not in the power of words to do it.</p>
               <p>Thus was he underſtood by all the world, excepting only the Eaſtern Biſhops, who had a quarrel againſt him, and therefore were reſolv'd to cavil; and even theſe at laſt were reconcil'd to his expreſſions. Thus the Fathers in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him, and the Catholick Church
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64435:137"/>ever ſince, yet all this it ſeems could not prevail with <hi>Derodon,</hi> who in oppoſition to almoſt all the world, maintains his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, that <hi>Cyril</hi> taught the ſame doctrine with <hi>Eutyches;</hi> and that <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was in the right.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe he cites out of <hi>Cyril</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral paſſages that affirm Chriſt to have but one <hi>nature;</hi> and this is that which was condemn'd in <hi>Eutyches.</hi> It is true indeed that <hi>Cyril</hi> does frequently own but one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it is to be obſerv'd that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in his ſenſe is the ſame with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and by both he means nothing but a real Union, in oppoſition to an imaginary, notional one, which <hi>Neſtorius</hi> did maintain. This may be eaſily obſerv'd by comparing all thoſe places where he affirms but <hi>one nature,</hi> with thoſe already alledg'd, that expreſly affirm the contrary. But beſides this, if he ſhall be allow'd to explain himſelf, the matter will be ſoon decided, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: Natural, that is,<note place="margin">Confir. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nath. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> a real Union.

                  </gap>, and the other to the Son of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is, ſo as to divide the

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one nature of the word; but of the word incarnate, <hi>i. e.</hi> one hypoſtaſis. For ſo he explains himſelf in the concluſion of that anſwer, that thoſe Orthodox that mention two natures, and he, are all of the ſame opinion; <hi>for ſince there is but one Son, one God, and Lord; ſo it is that we and they do confeſs one perſon only;</hi> for that was his deſign by the expreſſion of <hi>one nature:</hi> and that thoſe things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Divinity, and thoſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Humanity muſt be all aſcrib'd to one Chriſt: and juſtifying himſelf againſt ſuch as ſuſpected him of confounding the two natures in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> he denies that ever he took away <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to expreſs the ſame thing; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which though he diſowns to be his own words, but that <hi>John</hi> expreſs'd himſelf after that manner, yet he receives the ſenſe of them; that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things are to be underſtood of Chriſt as Man, and others of him as God; yet that the Godhead and the Manhood make but one Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In what ſenſe <hi>Cyril</hi> affirm'd one nature, appears further from what he condemn'd

                  </gap>, as being very improper to expreſs this hypoſtatical union of Chriſt: But that which he thinks comes neareſt to illuſtrate this Union, is that conjunction of body and ſoul in man, which is a concourſe of two very different natures, which yet make but one man; this is one of the greateſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove him a Heretick: but if this will ſerve to do it, moſt of the Fathers that wrote upon this ſubject, muſt be Hereticks
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64435:139"/>as well as he; ſince they all make uſe of this illuſtration.

What <hi>Cyril</hi> concludes is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that as the Body and Soul make one Man, ſo God and Man makes one Chriſt; and this is the compoſition that he means: which will be eaſily underſtood by comparing this with other paſſages of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril.</hi> If he judg'd that Chriſt had but one only nature reſulting out of that Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like that of Man; then it muſt be either the divine nature which had taken the humane into it ſelf, or that the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould be chang'd into his humanity, or ſome third nature that muſt reſult from both, all which he equally abhorrs; for notwithſtanding the incarnation,<note place="margin">Ep. ad Neſt. ad Acac. ad Joh. <hi>12.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathim. ad Succeſſ.</note> he affirms expreſly, <gap reason="foreign">

So that it appears plainly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64435:139"/>by the doctrine of <hi>Cyril,</hi> that he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge two natures in one perſon, and that when he oftentimes affirm'd one nature in Chriſt, he meant only one perſon; which he would not have divided and ſeparated from it ſelf, <gap reason="foreign">

I muſt beſeech the Readers Pardon for this digreſſion, and Gods Pardon to theſe falſe accuſers of their brethren, that they may know in this their day the things that belong to their peace.

               <p>It will not ſuit the proportion of my deſign to dwell upon every particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s that may be ſuſpected, and to detect the Hereſie of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the diſguiſe of Orthodox Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, I hope that what has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64435:144"/>obſerv'd, may be ſufficient at leaſt to ſuſpend the Readers judgement from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing <hi>Cyril</hi> a Heretick with <hi>Derodon,</hi> or <hi>Neſtorius</hi> (who was condemn'd by almoſt all the world) an Orthodox and ſound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever? until ſome abler hand undertake that matter, and treat it more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
               <p>Our Author though he make uſe of <hi>Dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s citations to diſparage the authority of theſe Councils, yet he differs from him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and is loth to give in to that bold Paradox, that <hi>Cyril</hi> ſo much celebrated in the Catholick Church for his defence of the faith, ſhould at laſt, after twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years good credit prove down-right Heretick. Therefore he endeavours to moderate the buſineſs, and to make both parties Friends and Orthodox, though they themſelves were not ſenſible of it! <hi>All this ſtir,</hi> ſaith our Author, <hi>proceeded only from miſunderſtanding, and</hi> Cyril <hi>and</hi> Neſtorius <hi>and the reſt of the Biſhops did not underſtand one anothers meaning:</hi> It is not unpleaſant to obſerve a man unacquainted with the language in which theſe diſputes were, pretend gravely to be Moderator, and to perſwade the World they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the terms they quarrelled about, though the language were vulgar to them all; and by the ſtrength of <hi>Hanmer</hi>'s, and other miſerable tranſlations, to play the Critick: but whether is moſt likely that theſe great and learned men ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64435:145"/>one anothers terms; or perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from their times many hundreds of years, and ignorant of the language in which they writ, I leave the Reader to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. It is true, that in this caſe there was great miſunderſtanding between <hi>Cyril</hi> and the Eaſtern Biſhops; yet we find that as ſoon as ever they came to debate the matter calmly, they found they differ'd but in expreſſion, and yet both found they differ'd widely from the doctrine of <hi>Neſtorius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though ſome few men might be tranſported, and miſtake one another in the heat of their contention, it is ſtrange that all the world ſhould be ſo blind and undiſcerning, that no man before our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhould find out this undiſcover'd agreement between the contending Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and not one have the fortune to ſtumble upon this obſervation. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does endeavour to ſatisfie this doubt, by ſhewing that <hi>beſides the factiouſneſs of the generality of the Biſhops, there were but few among them that had any learning;</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes it for the 6th.</note> But how ſhould this Prohibition make ignorant Biſhops in the Eaſt, where it had no force? Nor do we find any ſuch prohibition there, unleſs that of <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> to bring Chriſtian Religion into contempt, by making the profeſſors of it ignorant of all humane learning. 2. <hi>When no Biſhop was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64435:145"/>from place to place, but they were made in every Church out of an inferiour degree;</hi> why ſhould this keep them in ignorance, ſince they had the freedom of liberal edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and the lower degrees of the Church did no more incapacitate men for learning than they did for Epiſcopacy? 3. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities were rare, therefore no wonder if learned Biſhops were ſo rare:</hi> If Univerſity education be ſo neceſſary for learning; our Author I believe muſt keep theſe ignorant Biſhops company, and he will help them to more, if others heed what he writes of the Univerſities. But yet Philoſophy Schools were not ſo rare as he fanſies in the Eaſtern Church, for there was hardly a conſiderable City that had not one; and beſides all this, the great learning of the world being eaſily intelligible to the Eaſtern part of the World, as being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their common language; they had the leſs need of Profeſſors; and a man might go a great way with his own private Reading. 4. <hi>When Nectarius muſt be the great Patriarch that was no Chriſtian, and when Syneſius, becauſe he had Philoſophical knowledge, is choſen Biſhop even before he believ'd the Reſurrection!</hi> Learned men were very ſcarce, he would inferr; but it is hard to do ſo from theſe inſtances: for 1.

               <p>The Emperour by an unaccountable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe paſs'd all by till he came to his name, and fix'd there, and nominated him Biſhop: <hi>He was no Chriſtian,</hi> ſays our Author. He was not yet baptiz'd indeed, but he was a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:64435:146"/>Catechumen and a very good man, and wanted nothing but that conſummation; which was <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s condition till within a month before his death: and now let the ſhrewdeſt gueſſer in the world conſider whether the ſmall number of learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops was the reaſon why <hi>Nictarius</hi> was choſen to be the great Patriarch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Syneſius</hi> his promotion concludes the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of Biſhops no more than that of <hi>Nectarius.</hi> For <hi>Syneſius,</hi> beſides his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had a peculiar eloquence, and beſides that, was a perſon of an extraordinary life and reputation; ſo that it was not his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical learning was the only reaſon of his preferment: but <hi>he did not believe the Reſurrection;</hi> and ſurely there muſt be a great want of able men, when a perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that, and ſeveral other unqualifying circumſtances ſhould be forc'd into a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick.

               <p>The laſt thing by which he proves the ſcarcity of learned Biſhops, is the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> which <hi>Socrates</hi> that knew him does affirm: But here our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor does <hi>Socrates</hi> wrong, for he does not
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64435:147"/>ſay that <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was ignorant, but that he was unacquainted with the Fathers and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical writers, which made him condemn the word <gap reason="foreign">

As for Philoſophy, perhaps he had too much, and his writings do ſhew that he had no confus'd illogical Pen: So that this proves the ignorance of the Biſhops of thoſe times no more than the reſt.</p>
               <p>The truth is, our Author has the worſt luck in the world in his obſervations, where he ventures to dictate out of his own head, and to ſpeak ſomething new: He could not have likely pitch'd upon ſuch another age in all the Hiſtory of the Church as this, for multitude of eminent and learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and I believe I may ſay there is none that has recommended it ſelf to Poſterity by ſo numerous and ſubſtantial Monuments of learning. What ſhall we think of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, Ruffinus, Auguſtin,</hi> the two <hi>Cyrils, Theodoret?</hi> what ſhall we ſay of <hi>Syneſius, Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, Pelus,</hi> and infinite others? were theſe ignorant times that yielded ſuch eminent lights, ſuch renown'd Champions and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments to the Church of Chriſt? One may ſay with great truth that it was not till now that learning was become general among Chriſtians, and eſpecially in the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>alas</hi> (ſay our Author) <hi>how few Biſhops could diſtinguiſh then, as</hi> Derodon, <hi>and cur conimon Metaphyſicks do now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi>

               <p>There remains yet one conſiderable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt <hi>Cyril,</hi> which I have reſerv'd on purpoſe to the laſt place that I might anſwer it more at large, and I hope it will give great light unto the ſubject we have in hand. The objection is this, That <hi>Cyril</hi> father'd the doctrine of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> about the Incarnation upon his Maſter, <hi>Theodorus Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſis,</hi> and <hi>Theodorus Mopſueſtenius.</hi> But <hi>Theodore Tarſ. dy'd in the Communion</hi> of the Church, and was own'd by it, not only as a ſound Member, but as an eminent Champion for the truth. I will take notice at this time of this <hi>Theodore</hi> only, whoſe diſcrple <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus</hi> takes great pains to vindicate him, and does it very effectually; but as for this charge of <hi>Cyril,</hi> he does not well know what to ſay; ſometimes he is in doubt of the matter of fact, whether <hi>Cyril</hi> did condemn his doctrines, and write againſt him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in doing ſo, he muſt depart not only from the reſt of the Fathers, but from himſelf too: For in ſome of his writings he is very high in his commendation: <hi>Scripti ſunt à Magno Theodore</hi> (ſays Cyril. ap.

               <p>Now for the clearing of this matter we muſt obſerve, that though <hi>Theodore</hi> was no Heretick, yet there was Hereſie among his writings, foiſted in by the followers of <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> and this is the very Hereſie for which <hi>Cyril</hi> condemns him.

But whatever were the reaſon, it is evident by his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he had a pique againſt <hi>Cyril;</hi> who was oppos'd in every thing by the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64435:152"/>Emperours Officers: A little Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of about thirty Biſhops, with <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Candidianus</hi> at the head of them, ſet up againſt the Council, condemn'd <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Memnon,</hi> and gave the Emperour an account of what they had done, he ſent <hi>Johannes Comes</hi> with Order to depoſe <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, Memnon</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius.</hi>
                  </q> This <hi>John</hi> gives a ſad account of the confuſion all things were in, and of the heats of Biſhops; but is very much to be ſuſpected. For the tenour of his relation makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he was a partizan of the Eaſtern Biſhops, and therefore endeavours to lay all the blame upon <hi>Cyril</hi> and his party: but ſure I am that the confuſion which he repreſents cannot be much greater than our Author makes in the ſenſe of this <hi>John;</hi> and the Biſhops could not underſtand one another much worſe than our Author did that Epiſtle. <hi>They would have the</hi> Scriptures <hi>read</hi> (ſays our learned Tranſlator) <hi>but they that favour'd</hi> Cyril <hi>ſaid, that the divine and terrible</hi> Scriptures <hi>were not to be read without</hi> Cyril; <hi>the Biſhops that were with</hi> John <hi>ſaid, that</hi> Cyril <hi>ought not to be preſent at the reading of the Scriptures.</hi> One would imagine that this Officer would have read a Chapter of <hi>Job</hi> to recommend patience to theſe violent Biſhops; but it is quite another matter, for theſe <hi>terrible Scriptures</hi> were nothing elſe but the Emperours Letter, which in the language of thoſe times was call'd <hi>Sacra;</hi> and <hi>Sacra Scriptura</hi> in this place, as every
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64435:153"/>body knows that has any acquaintance with theſe times, or has but read this Letter; for the ſecret is diſcover'd within a few lines, <hi>Auguſtarum literarum lectionem fecit, in quibus depoſiti ſunt</hi> Cyrillus &amp; Neſtorius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now it is no wonder if all things were in confuſion, and all parties, unleſs that ſmall one of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> diſſatisfy'd; the Orthodox look'd upon the faith as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in the condemnation of <hi>Cyril,</hi> and to ſuffer in the ſame proſcription with him; and the greateſt part of the Chriſtian Church look'd upon it ſelf as engag'd in the ſame cauſe: therefore the Emperour conſidering better of it, whether out of fear that all the world in a manner would oppoſe this ſentence, or being better inform'd concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Cyril,</hi> revok'd this decree, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd the depoſition and baniſhment of <hi>Neſtorius;</hi> and conſidering the party of <hi>John</hi> was but inconſiderable in reſpect of thoſe that own'd the Council, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who probably might have made uſe of them againſt <hi>Cyril,</hi> commands them now to be reconcil'd to him, to condemn <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorius,</hi> to receive the Council; and <hi>Cyril</hi> was only deſir'd to ſacrifice his reſentments of the injuries received at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to the peace and ſettlement of the Church; and ſo at laſt <hi>Cyril</hi> and the Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> prevail'd againſt all the little arts that were us'd to blaſt their reputation, and by the means of <hi>Paulus Emiſſenus</hi> a perfect reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was effected, ſo ſincere, that the old
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64435:153"/>contentions are chang'd into friendſhip and confidence, and <hi>Cyril</hi> ſends ſome of his books to <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> to reviſe and correct. So far were they from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a <hi>Fire brand</hi> and <hi>incendiary as long as they liv'd:</hi> as our Author repreſents the matter.</p>
               <p>But this reconciliation does as little pleaſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as their diſſentions: There is no thanks to the Biſhops for this; <hi>the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours threatning Letter cur'd them all of Hereſie; and good men! they were all this while of one mind and did not know it:</hi> It is ſome ſign of good nature that they would ſubmit to the powerful interpoſition of the Emperour; but there is a temper, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is acquainted with, that is not to be prevail'd upon either by threats or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes from the Magiſtrate, and ſeems to hate nothing ſo much as compliance with Superiours: there are ſome that ſcorn to preach by the licence of the Government, and place the Kingdom of Chriſt purely in oppoſition to Laws and Magiſtrates.</p>

               <p>IT is the general weakneſs of our minds not to think we have ſufficiently avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one extreme, unleſs we run into the other; and to be ſtill running away from what we diſlike, we care not whither, without conſidering what inconveniences the contrary extreme may expoſe us to! This is frequent among us, not only in what relates to our paſſions and manners, but to our faith. <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> for fear of blaſphemy, diſſolv'd the incomprehenſible unity of the ſon, and fell into blaſphemy on the oppoſite ſide, denying Chriſt to be <hi>Deus verus:</hi>

                  <hi>Eutyches,</hi> abhorring this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, thought he was not ſafe till he had deny'd Chriſt to be <hi>verum hominem:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Brevic. de Hiſt. Eutyc.</note> and this became the occaſion of a great deal of ſtir and tumults in the Chriſtian World.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Eutyches</hi> (who to our comfort was no Biſhop, but an Abbot,) having pleas'd himſelf ſome time with his notion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſon of Chriſt, was not content to enjoy it himſelf, but was ambitious to propagate it: He therefore drew up a new
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64435:154"/>Creed different from thoſe which had been ſet forth by all the Councils before him, and ſent a Copy of this Confeſſion into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Monaſteries, to deſire Subſcriptions.<note place="margin">Act. con. C. P.</note> This got wind, and <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dorylaeum,</hi> having notice of this practice, adviſes <hi>Eutyches</hi> as a friend to deſiſt from ſuch dangerous enterprizes, and to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in the decrees of the Councils of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Epheſus. Eutyches</hi> purſues his courſe, and <hi>Euſebius</hi> reports the whole matter to <hi>Flavian:</hi> who having called a ſmall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Biſhops at <hi>C. P.</hi> ſends for <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> thither. He at firſt refuſes to come; but afterwards, being encourag'd by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Eunuch, he comes to the Council as if he had been going to a war, guarded not only with his Monks but with Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the Emperours guards, where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome tergiverſation he diſcover'd his Hereſie, and the Council having admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd him to retract, but without effect, condemn'd him as a Heretick.</p>
               <p>Our Author makes <hi>Eutyches</hi> as Orthodox as <hi>Cyril;</hi> and would ſhew that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd for the doctrine of the Council of <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Brevic. de Hiſt.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64435:155"/>upon every occaſion, that Chriſt is truly Man as well as God, and perfect too, as conſiſting of Body and Soul, nor did he deny two natures in Chriſt, but only ſaid that they were not ſeparated or divided; that there was no <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>There is one thing more in <hi>Eutyches</hi> his way of expreſſing himſelf which is liable to exception; and that is, that before the union, there were two natures, afterwards they were but one; if he ſpeaks of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular natures of Chriſt, this muſt be very
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64435:156"/>impious or abſurd; either it muſt imply that the divinity was united to Chriſt after he was come in the Fleſh, or that he was at firſt but a meer man, and the divinity was united to him afterwards, for the merit of his obedience; or elſe that the man was before his birth: the firſt I think <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches</hi> did not hold, the latter was ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Leo,</hi>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64435:160"/>nature in the conceſſion. But where is the wonder all this while? that matters ſhould change, and yet ſhe be ſtill the ſame?

               <p>From whence it is manifeſt that <hi>Socrates</hi> wrote in that peaceful interval between the firſt and ſecond Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and could not think of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in reſpect of the <hi>Eutychians;</hi> and ſo Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> might have been ſpar'd; for <hi>Socrates</hi> ſays not one word of any miracles in approbation of his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Eutychians;</hi> or that any were done in favour of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> after that, for the Hiſtory does not reach ſo far.

                  <hi>that he cleav'd to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine Council, and to</hi> Cyril <hi>who preſided, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming all additions and alterations, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that he had himſelf Copies in a book, which</hi> Cyril <hi>himſelf had ſent him, and which is yet in his hands; and that he ſtands to the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Council together with that of</hi> Nice: One may very well ask here, what all this means?

What <hi>Copies are theſe</hi> that <hi>Eutyches</hi> had by him? and what <hi>definition of that Council</hi> does he join with that of <hi>Nice?</hi> Here is nothing but nonſenſe and confuſion.

                  </note> for which <hi>Eutyches</hi> does mention it. The deſign of that decree is only this, that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed ſhall be the only publick form,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64435:166"/>and that no other be taught, to ſuch as are <hi>Converted from Jews,</hi> or <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels;</hi> but that this form ſhould ſtand unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd: which is no more than if we ſhould determine that no Article ſhould be added to that which is call'd the Apoſtles Creed, which is the common form of our ſolemn confeſſion of faith; and that no Biſhop or Miniſter ſhould deviſe new forms to be us'd in its ſtead. This is the deſign of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; and <hi>Cyril</hi> could mean no otherwiſe: for if any one ſhould teach new doctrines that might not be abſolutely contradictory to the expreſs words of that Creed, yet he ſhould be condemn'd though he ſtill own'd that Confeſſion of Faith: <hi>Neſtorius</hi> his caſe was of that ſort, and therefore the Synod ſays,<note place="margin">Con.

There is good reaſon for that: for <hi>Flavian</hi> could not be condemn'd, unleſs <hi>Eytyches</hi> were abſolv'd; and that thoſe very men that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd him did not think he was of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, though their expreſſions were the ſame, appears manifeſtly from the manner of their tranſacting that affair; for when ſome well-meaning Biſhops were ſo curious as to deſire he ſhould explain himſelf in that point of doctrine for which alone he had been call'd in queſtion, <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids any farther ſearch, for fear Hereſie would appear, and then <hi>Flavian</hi> muſt be acquitted. The Caſe was juſt as if a Papiſt were to purge himſelf of that Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in an <hi>Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> and ſhould offer the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> for his Faith: But ſome honeſt plain men, not ſatisfy'd with this Impertinent vindication in thoſe things he was not queſtion'd for, putting croſs queſtions about <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> or <hi>Supremacy,</hi> ſhould immediately be check'd, and all ſhould cry, we will have nothing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith; would not any one conclude that this Reverend Aſſembly was afraid Popery would appear, and that the man that for private Reaſons they would acquit for that time, would diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to hold ſuch opinions, as he could not be able to approve to that Aſſembly? This is the naked caſe; from whence the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may judge, how far theſe were of one
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64435:168"/>mind: and that men of very different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions joyn'd to ſerve a preſent turn; and united in deſign, when they knew ſome of them, that their doctrines could never be reconcil'd.</p>

Though at firſt the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſeem'd not to underſtand what <hi>Flavian</hi> meant by two natures; yet it is evident that there was ſomething of wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that miſtake; and at the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> it was quite taken away, and all ſubſcrib'd to two natures, that yet own'd <hi>Cyril</hi>'s expreſſions of but one <hi>Nature Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi>

Though in the Council of <hi>C. P.

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had great reaſon to note the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence of <hi>Binius,</hi> in calling this allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Euſtathius</hi> out of <hi>Cyril,</hi> to be Wicked and Heretical; ſince he does no more than cite <hi>Cyril</hi>'s words: but this remark is left out of latter Editions.</p>
               <p>After this, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> brings in <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himſelf by the authority of <hi>Cyril,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 104.</note> And although our Author ſeems to be diſſatisfy'd that when <hi>Dioſcorus offers ſatisfaction to God and you,</hi> i. e. <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius Doryl.</hi> his repentance was not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet I ſuppoſe he is not in earneſt; for upon other occaſions he is inexorable in much leſſer matters: and ſurely if any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours may depoſe a Biſhop that has nothing to plead but the Orthodoxneſs of his belief, <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> was juſtly condemn'd, and yet our Author obſerves that a <hi>verbal quarrel was turn'd to perſonal revenge,</hi> becauſe <hi>Euſebius Doryl.</hi> reply'd upon <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> that <hi>he muſt ſatisfie the law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> concludes his citations out of the firſt Action of this Council, with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the Biſhops in the Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> whereby they abſolv'd <hi>Eutyches;</hi> which being read in the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> the Biſhops concern'd had no excuſe, but to cry, <hi>Omnes peccavimus.</hi> Our Author it ſeems takes great delight in repeating as often as he can this recantation of thoſe Biſhops, looking upon it, I ſuppoſe, as a great undervaluing and reproach to confeſs an errour. The Spirit of Schiſm is very nice in point of honour, and reckons no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo great a diſgrace as the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of a miſtake; where it is once engag'd, no conviction ſhall be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it, though it be in the moſt indefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64435:170"/>thing in the World. And though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and conſcience ſhould oblige to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; yet in honour he muſt not recede, nor recant what no Rhetorick is able to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate. Recantation, whether they be in the right or the wrong, appears equally infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. A late brisk defender of <hi>Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> out of fondneſs for a ſmart ſaying in <hi>Religio Medici</hi> has dropp'd an unlucky truth, <hi>that he is not ſo much afraid as aſham'd of Conformity.</hi> I have charity enough to believe him that he is indeed aſham'd of owning that which he has ſo fiercely oppos'd, not ſo much by his reaſoning, as by his <hi>ill manners</hi> and <hi>ſcurrility.</hi> For my part I do not envy theſe men this inflexible ſtiffneſs of Spirit, but do ſincerely pity them, although the witty Author juſt now mention'd has derided <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> no leſs than Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Recantation. However I had rather be found among thoſe Biſhops that cry'd <hi>Peccavimus</hi> after a fault, which yet had all the excuſes that can be made from violence and compulſion; than to maintain a Schiſm upon a point of honour, and for ſhame of confeſſing to have been in the wrong.</p>
               <p>In the third Action, among many things,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 104.</note> our <hi>Abridger</hi> of <hi>Church-Hiſtory</hi> faſtens upon the law of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> for the confirming of the ſecond <hi>Epheſine</hi> Council, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and of <hi>Flavianus, Domnus, &amp;c.</hi> One would expect here that our Hiſtorian being tir'd with throwing dirt
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64435:171"/>at the Biſhops and their Councils, ſhould divert the outragious Spirit, by giving him one looſe at Emperours and Courts. But no ſuch matter, he ſcorns to change his game, and therefore charges the Biſhops with the faults of the Magiſtrate, and lays all the blame upon them; <hi>So far</hi> (ſays he) <hi>could fierce and factious Prelates prevail with a pious and peaceable Prince, by the pretences of oppoſing Hereſie and Schiſm.</hi>] And what authority has our Author to ground this obſervation upon?

(will you ſay) no extraordinary matter: Only Mr. <hi>B.</hi> when he comes to make obſervations miſtakes the Fact, and the more bitter and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous he endeavours to be, the greateſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights he uſually commits. It was once the hard fortune of the Chriſtians to father eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry calamity that befel the publick; if the Army had evil ſucceſs, or the Harveſt prov'd ſcanty; if peſtilence, or famine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the Heathens, the Chriſtians were the cauſe of all this Miſchief: To the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the Stake with them. It fares no better with the Biſhops in Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Hiſtory; whatever is done amiſs, it is by their procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whoſe act ſoever that be, a Princes or an Eunuchs, or a Monks, or a Womans, yet
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64435:171"/>ſtill the blame is the Biſhops. And this is the cry which ſome men teach their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to uſe. If Trade fail, O theſe Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Biſhops ſpoyl all; if a Brother ſhut up Shop, and conveys himſelf away without evening his accounts, the Biſhops have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done him. The truth is, theſe men or their neighbours have great reaſon to pray the Biſhops may always continue; for this peeviſhneſs and gall which is ſo predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in this party of men, if it have not its ordinary vent, will taint the blood, and turn into Jaundice and other evil diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; or if it fly out, it will diſturb the peace of the family, or of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or it may be of the Kingdome: So neceſſary it is for this ſort of men to have ſomething to rail at, and to exerciſe that freedom of ſpeech upon, which is part of their <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place our Author relates at large out of the fifth Action of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, (which he miſtook for the fourth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceiv'd by the running Title in <hi>Binius</hi> that is falſe Printed) what paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Council and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; and this he did not think fit to <hi>Abridge,</hi> becauſe he did not conceive it much for the honour of the perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. The debate it muſt be confeſs'd was ſomething too warm; but that heat was not altogether without reaſon. The caſe in ſhort was thus: The Council had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd <hi>Eutyches</hi> for a Heretick, and <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:64435:172"/>for receiving him into Communion, and for other Miſdemeanours. The <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Biſhops, conſidering how far they were engag'd in the ſame crime, and ſtanding in a near Relation to <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> began to be afraid that they might poſſibly be involv'd in the ſame puniſhment: and therefore petition'd the Emperour, declaring the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of their faith; and condemning all Hereſies, but not naming <hi>Eutyches.</hi> This Petition was read before the Council, which immediately made this exception, <hi>Why did they not condemn</hi> Eutyches? They anſwer'd, that they condemn'd him, or any body elſe, that taught any thing againſt the faith. This was look'd upon as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſory anſwer: and the Council began to preſs them cloſer: At laſt they condemn'd <hi>Eutyches.</hi> Having been brought thus far, they were call'd upon to ſubſcribe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. This they ſcrupl'd, which made the Council jealous of them, upon the account of their dependance upon <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſcorus,</hi> and of their behaviour in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Epheſine</hi> Council: and therefore they reſolv'd to preſs the point home. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> pretended they could not ſubſcribe according to the cuſtome of their Church without their <hi>Patriarch.</hi> Their Tergiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation all along made the Biſhops look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this as a Trick; yet at laſt, when they underſtood the caſe, they admitted of this expedient; that they ſhould give ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity that they ſhould not leave <hi>Chalcedon</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:64435:172"/>before they had a New Metropolitan, and ſo the debate ended. If this buſineſs ſeem to have been manag'd with too much heat, it is not much to be wondred at, all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſider'd, and eſpecially the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and provocations that ſeveral of the Council had receiv'd before from <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and his party. Men will be men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are plac'd, whether in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or in the Church, or even at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next buſineſs</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>B.</hi>) <hi>was with the Abbots of the Monks</hi> (it would have been great news to have found Abbots of Seculars,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 106. <hi>ſect.</hi> 25.</note>) <hi>who had petition'd the Emperour for a Council to end their broyls, and that without perturbations. Theſe petition'd that</hi> Dioſcorus <hi>might be call'd:</hi> He was <hi>call'd</hi> indeed ſeveral times before, but he did not think fit to come; but they would have him <hi>reſtor'd;</hi> and the Council oppoſing them, they began to talk imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently about Religion. Among theſe was <hi>Barſumas,</hi> who had headed a great number of the ſame ſort of Cattel at the Second <hi>Epheſine</hi> Council, and had aſſiſted in the murdering of <hi>Flavian,</hi> encouraging his Monks to make ſure work, <hi>kill, ſlay, knock him on the head,</hi> &amp;c. It is not unlikely but ſome of theſe, if not all, (for ſome in this Council charge him with having headed 1000 Monks) had been with him at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> and it is not very material whether ſuch giddy ſanguinary fellows were ſatisfy'd with the Council or no. If the countenance
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64435:173"/>of this ſort of men ſignify'd any thing, there was number enough that own'd the Council, and give the Emperour thanks, <hi>that his Chriſtian Authority had caſt out</hi> Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>At laſt</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>B.</hi>) <hi>there was a diſſention whether</hi> Leo<hi>'s phraſe ſhould be put into their Definition of Faith,</hi>

This inſerting of it into their Definition was, I believe, no other than what we find in the larger De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Faith drawn up in this Council; where the Epiſtle of <hi>Leo</hi> is receiv'd, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thoſe of <hi>Cyril</hi> to <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Faith deliver'd them by the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſays that <hi>Leo's Epiſtle was a while run down.</hi> There was no ſuch thing, but only ſome ſaid <hi>that their Rule of Faith was full enough without it.</hi> It was not becauſe they had any exception againſt the doctrine of it, but becauſe they would preſerve their Rule as ſimple, and with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle addition as they could. But at laſt it was yielded to, ſaith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> when the <hi>Illyrican Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had firſt ſlighted</hi> Rome, and cryed, <hi>Qui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicunt (Definitioni) Neſtoriani ſunt, qui contradicunt,</hi> Romam <hi>ambulent:</hi> He muſt be very captious that can interpret this for a ſlight; And it does not appear, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, who were uſually very apprehenſive
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64435:173"/>of ſlights put upon their See, did take any notice of it. I am not very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned whether it were or no, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I do not find in my ſelf any great devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for that See to vindicate it from any ſlights, yet I believe this we now ſpeak of was never intended as one. Only our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, according to the uſual ſucceſs of his obſervations, miſunderſtands the matter. <hi>The Judges aſſiſting in this Council</hi> propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it as the Emperours direction,<note place="margin">

But what ſhall we ſay to theſe lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of theſe Councils? Was it the misfortune, or the fault of theſe only, not to be able to heal the differences of the Church? Or elſe was the defect in the Councils, or the blame to be imputed to thoſe obſtinate men that oppos'd the Rule eſtabliſh'd by them? Theſe were not the firſt Councils that have miſcarried as to their deſign of Univerſal Reconciliation. The Council of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> under the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that determined the Controverſie about Circumciſion; did not preſently ſilence all Diſputes about that Queſtion: For the Church of <hi>Galatia</hi> was preſently after divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about it. The Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> though it quieted the <hi>Arian</hi> Controverſie for a while, yet it was not able to prevent thoſe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64435:176"/>lamentable Contentions which the ſame que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion afterwards occaſioned. Or if <hi>Biſhops and their Councils</hi> could provide no effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Remedies for the violent diſtempers of the Church; let us ſee what <hi>Presbyterian Synods</hi> have done. The Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and Subſcrib'd cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Articles, declaring their Doctrine in the points in Controverſie; yet the diſeaſe was ſo far from ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ting, that it grew more violent, and the Civil Magiſtrate was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ſecond the determinations of the Synod by inflicting Impriſonment and Exile upon ſuch as would not ſubſcribe; and yet all this would not do, for the ſame breach remains unclos'd unto this day. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in his meek Anſwer to the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermon ſays very kind things of the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines:</hi> and yet theſe, with their <hi>Catechiſms, Directory,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations,</hi> and Overthrowing of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Church Government, (upon which they charg'd all the Miſcarriages, and Diviſions of the Church,) were ſo far from Reconciling the people, that after this they were diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into innumerable Schiſms. Never was there ſo lamentable a face of things; never ſuch variety of Hereſie, and ſuch wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and Extravagance in Blaſpheming God, under pretence of Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and this is the ſtate whither the ſame manner of Men are driving again. <q>Experience (they ſay) is the Miſtriſs of Fools, but they are Fools to be begg'd

               <p>Now ſince Councils, whether of Biſhops, or Presbyters, have oftentimes ſo bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, what is to be done? What other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall we find more effectual? The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have left the uſe of General Councils of late, He who had among them the chief authority of ſummoning ſuch Councils, being grown jealous of that way; and the Condition of the Eccleſiaſtical Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire has been for ſome ages not unlike that in which <hi>Livy</hi> repreſents the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Roman Empire in his time, <hi>nec vitia noſtra ferre poſſumus nec remedia.</hi>

               <p>At laſt a great part of the Weſtern Church weary of expecting relief by a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council from that Tyranny and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption under which it labour'd, was forc'd to uſe extraordinary means to reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and what they could not do all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they did ſeverally, as they had Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It was the good fortune of our Church to Reform it ſelf with the countenance and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Civil Magiſtrate, and therefore they could do it by degrees, and with greater Moderation, than other Churches, who muſt contend with the Civil power about it, and who had no other ſtrength than the zealand Reſolution of the People. As ſoon as this Reformation began to take root deep enough here, the Clergy, Aſſembled in a National Synod, eſtabliſh'd a rule for Unity
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64435:177"/>and peace, and to prevent diſputes as much as was poſſible: This rule comprehended the Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline of this Church which was at firſt receiv'd with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal joy and approbation, None but <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> oppoſing it; But ſome time after ſome few diſcontented men under pretence of Zeal againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> took the part of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt this rule; and it is obſervable, that as one faction grew up and gather'd ſtrength, ſo did the other; that one's right and left hand can hardly grow in evener proportion; ſo that one would fancy, that either they advanc'd by ſome ſecret conſent, or were nouriſh'd from the ſame Common Stomach; It may be from him that <hi>Palavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cini</hi> calls the Stomach as well as the Head of the Church, the <hi>Pope:</hi> And what ſhall be at laſt done for theſe Proteſtants, as they call themſelves? Shall every one be left to himſelf without any rule? The effect of this will be, that in a little time we ſhall have no Religion at all. Shall this rule be alter'd? We can have no aſſuance that when it is alter'd, we ſhall find any Conformity to it then more than now; and this, as it is, has the advantage of any innovation, if for nothing elſe, yet for its ſtanding, and that it is an Antient Eſtabliſhment. In ſhort, theſe that Cry out againſt this rule, ſeem to have a great reſpect for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and that Reign is counted the Golden age of this Kingdom.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Authors of Hereſies, Schiſms, and Corruptions, and whether they were all Biſhops.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have hitherto gone along with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſtep by ſtep, conceiving it neceſſary to make a more particular Vindication of the Church in theſe times, as well becauſe they were the beſt that the Chriſtian World has had for true piety and zeal; as alſo becauſe our Church Profeſſes to receive the four firſt General Councils; and laſtly becauſe all ſober moderate Chriſtians have always had, and ſtill retain a great eſteem and venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for many of thoſe perſons that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented ſo odiouſly in Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 's Church-Hiſtory. I do not pretend to juſtifie eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that was done by all the Biſhops and Councils of thoſe times. There have been wicked men, and wicked Biſhops in all times, and the Church under the Apoſtles, nay their own Order, was not ſo happy as to have none but good men of it. But I hope I have ſhewed ſufficiently that things were not as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> repreſents them; and that moſt of his particular Accuſations are
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:64435:178"/>void of all truth and ingenuity. I muſt deal with him hereafter more Summarily, and Anſwer the drift and deſign of his Book, which is to render <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> Odious under the more invidious name of <hi>Dioceſan Prelacy;</hi> a diſtinction without ground or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, as I have already ſhew'd, and will be yet more fully made out.</p>
               <p>The main deſign or Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Hiſtory is 1. To charge the Biſhops with all <hi>Schiſms; Hereſies, Corruptions, &amp;c.</hi> 2. To ſhew,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 27. §. 7.4</note> that <hi>Dioceſan Prelacy</hi> and <hi>grandeur is not the Cure, nor ever was;</hi> And to this purpoſe are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd all the particulars of his Church-Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. In this Chapter I will endeavour to take off the firſt general Charge.</p>
               <p>That ſome Biſhops have abus'd their Office and Authority, and have been the cauſe of Hereſie, or Schiſm, cannot be deny'd; but Prieſts, Deacons and Laymen have been ſo too; and therefore if the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of any particular man becomes a prejudice to his Office, and the Order muſt ſuffer for the perſonal faults of thoſe that are of it, we muſt have neither Prieſts nor Deacons in the Church, ſince ſome of them have been Authours of Hereſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is not all, our Author tho' he ſpeaks indefinitely, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he <hi>will ſhew the ignorant</hi> (and he muſt be very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that knows no better) <hi>who have been the cauſe of Church Corruptions, Hereſies, Schiſms, Sedition;</hi> yet he means they were the Authors of <hi>all</hi> theſe evils; as he is pleas'd
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64435:179"/>to explain himſelf p. 72. <hi>Next we have a ſtrange thing, a Hereſie rais'd by one that was no Biſhop:</hi> and then, as if that were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, he ſhews that was no Hereſie; and ſo the Biſhops remain under the whole charge of raiſing all Hereſies. I wiſh he had left <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi> out of this charge; for if he can perſwade the <hi>Ignorant Readers</hi> that the Biſhops were the cauſe of all theſe too; they will never be perſwaded that any <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are to be found in Church-Hiſtory. For if they had been in the world, they muſt have had their ſhare with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Sedition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a heavy charge, to accuſe the Biſhops of all the Hereſies and Schiſms that have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the Church, and if it were true, would go near to ſtagger the Reverence that one might have for the Order. For though Biſhops as well as other men may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Miſcarriages, they might be allow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d the frailty of Humane nature, from which no dignity can exempt us; But to be found the cauſe of <hi>All</hi> the Evils that have befallen the Church, would argue ſuch a malignity in the Conſtitution, as would ſhew plainly that God never deſign'd them for good. But I believe this can be no more prov'd againſt them by matter of fact, than that Biſhops invented Gun-powder, or Hand-Granadoes, or were the Authors of the Scotch Covenant, or the late Rebellion of the Field Conventiclers in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:64435:179"/>
               <p>Let us then trace the Hereſies and Schiſms that have torn the Church in pieces in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ages of it, to their firſt original; and examine who were the Authors of them; and if it appear out of Church-Hiſtory that Biſhops rais'd them <hi>All,</hi> or the greateſt part, I will give up the Cauſe, and believe every thing in Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Hiſtory; and for penance read over all the fourſcore Books that he tells us he has written.</p>
               <p>Where then ſhall we begin? If the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould be convicted by the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it would be ominous: However, becauſe it ſhall appear that I deal imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, I will begin with the firſt. All Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Writers do agree that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was the Author of the firſt Hereſie in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.<note place="margin">Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</note> 
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> indeed reckons up about a ſcore of Hereſies before this,<note place="margin">Epiph. Haer. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note> but they are Heathen or Jewiſh Hereſies; and I hope Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will be ſo kind as to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the Biſhops had nothing to do with theſe.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Simon</hi> was a Heretick, all are agreed in, though the Scripture ſay no ſuch thing; and though <hi>Epiphanius</hi> confeſs that his Sect cannot truly be reckon'd among Chriſtians.<note place="margin">Haer. <hi>21.</hi> p. <hi>55.</hi> Ed; Pet.</note> This man did teach very ſtrange, and, if there be any ſuch, <hi>damnable doctrines.</hi> But that he was a Biſhop no man ever yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> thought he had ſeen an Inſcription at <hi>Rome</hi> to this <hi>Simon,</hi> which own'd him a God, though it is poſſible this might be a miſtake: But that ever any Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64435:180"/>or Tradition called him a Biſhop, I have not heard. It is true indeed, he had a great mind to be a Biſhop; that is, to have power of Confirmation; and <hi>that every one on whom he ſhould lay his hands ſhould receive the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Novatus</hi> an <hi>African</hi> Prieſt began this Sect; I have given his Hiſtory before; and ſhewn how he ſeduced <hi>Novatianus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſt,<note place="margin">Epiph.

               <p>His is the 65th Sect in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> or the 45th Chriſtian Hereſie. This <hi>Paulus</hi> was a very ill man, and taught dangerous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that Chriſt was not God:<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>30.</hi>
                  </note> But though he was really a Heretick, yet he was not the Author of this Hereſie. He is ſaid by <hi>Euſebius</hi> (and the reſt out of him) to have learn'd this from <hi>Artemas,</hi> (as he calls him) or <hi>Artemon;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiph. &amp;c.</note> as alſo from <hi>Theodotus</hi> who began to teach this doctrine, and to gather him a Sect under <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by whom he was excommunicated.</p>

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:64435:184"/>Schiſm; this is manifeſtly the preſent caſe; there is no account of any Schiſm made about this point till after this <hi>Nepos</hi> his death; And <hi>Dionyſius</hi> who writes againſt him, thinks himſelf oblig'd to make his Apology before hand; ſaying, that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd the man for many great good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and was ſorry that he was forc'd to write againſt his Brother in the defence of Truth: And as to the matter of fact, it was thus, He found in the Region of <hi>Arſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe</hi> ſeveral Churches diſtracted about this matter; ſo that they began to make Schiſms in ſeveral places: The Biſhops ſurely muſt be concern'd, where there is any Schiſm or Hereſie, they muſt have a hand in it: But here by good fortune no ſuch thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears;<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>7</hi>

But what became of the Biſhop of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will you ſay? It may be he was dead, and that this <hi>Nepos</hi> was the man; unleſs one may imagine the Dioceſs of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to extend ſo far; for the Country adjoyning to the Lake <hi>Mareotes,</hi> and call'd by that name, was part of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as we have ſhew'd before out of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> and the <hi>Arſinoeites</hi> was the next Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to that: But however this be, our point is ſufficiently clear'd, that this <hi>Nepos</hi> was neither Heretick, nor Schiſmatick: Nor does it appear that any Biſhop was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64435:185"/>in that difference, ſave only <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who by his Prudence and Authority did compoſe it.

               <p>The following Ages were not ſo happy; but as Chriſtians generally degenerated, ſo did the Clergy too; but yet not ſo much as our Author would make it appear. The beginning of the fourth Century was very unhappy to the Church; not only by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a moſt violent Perſecution rais'd againſt it from without, but alſo of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Schiſms from within. <hi>Meletius</hi> an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Biſhop,<note place="margin">Meletius.</note> and the firſt of that Order that began a Schiſm, forſook the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, becauſe they that fell from the Faith under Perſecution were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into it,<note place="margin">Epiph.</note> as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells his ſtory; though others of better Authority give other Reaſons, that this Biſhop had himſelf deny'd the Faith; and being condemn'd by a Synod of Biſhops, he ſet up a Schiſm: But of this we have ſaid enough elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.<note place="margin">Athan.

But if I ſhould joyn with him <hi>Theodotus</hi> the <hi>Tanner,</hi> (who liv'd indeed a good while before) Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Weavers and Plow-men might be hard put to it, and reconcil'd to their Trades again.</p>

                  </note> and his followers as great Hypocrites: Theſe it is probable were the <hi>Anthropomorphites</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that were ſo violent againſt the followers of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his time, who he ſays, communicated with the Catholick Church; and for that reaſon it may be, he ſpeaks ſo favourably of them.</p>

               <p>The Hereſie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> though an unavoidable conſequence of <hi>Entyches</hi> his Doctrine, yet it is generally father'd upon <hi>Cyrus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria: Sergius</hi> of C.

But with the ſame ſucceſs that uſually all ſuch deſigns have: when the Rule is changed, the Church is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately all to pieces, and thoſe that were united under that Rule divide into parties and factions; which will hardly ever unite again.</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:64435:191"/>
               <p>Now becauſe in the following ages of the Church the Devil had another game to play, and ſtarted up but few Hereſies until theſe laſt ages; let us ſee what ſort of men the Authors of them have been. The <hi>Swenkfeldians, Anabaptiſts, Menoniſts, The Family of Love, Quakers, Ranters,</hi> and the reſt of the Modern Sects; did theſe derive themſelves from any Biſhops? <hi>Servetus</hi> (whom the Miniſters of <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as far or further than <hi>Idacius</hi> ever did the <hi>Priſcillianiſts</hi>) was he a Biſhop? <hi>Socinus</hi> was he a Prelate? or the <hi>Racovian</hi> Divines, were they a Council of Biſhops? how then comes it to be ſo great a wonder as our Author profeſſès it to be, <hi>that a Hereſie ſhould be rais'd by one</hi> that was <hi>No Biſhop?</hi> It is much a greater wonder that any one that makes Conſcience of what he ſays, ſhould againſt all truth of Hiſtory, and againſt his own knowledge, charge the Biſhops with all the Hereſies in the World; that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſeems to be ſo ſenſible of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgement, as frequently to put himſelf in mind of it in his Writings, and even force the belief of good charitable men by ſuch profeſſions of Sincerity; ſhould yet advance ſo malicious and ſo groundleſs an Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is no dallying with the all-ſeeing God; and if every idle word will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, what plea ſhall be made for whole books full of Calumny and Detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? What for blaſting the memory of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Holy men for ought he knows that are
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64435:192"/>dead? What for aſperſing ſo many faithful Servants of God, for ought he knows, that are living? What for defaming the whole Order from which he receiv'd his Miniſtry? and to which he owes Honour and Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he will ſurely find in that day when he comes to give account of all the hard things that he has written againſt it.</p>
               <p>But if you would have the True Cauſes of Schiſm, Hereſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You muſt not look upon this or that Order of Men, but go up to the firſt Original of ſuch things. Theſe Miſchiefs, as all other diſturbances of the World, proceed <hi>from our Luſts which war in our Members:</hi> and do not flow from any particular Inſtitution or Order, but from the General Corruption of Humane Nature; by which means all conditions, and degrees of men, have had the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to have ſome that have been wicked and infamous. The Apoſtles had a <hi>Judas,</hi> the Biſhops a <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters a <hi>Novatus</hi> and an <hi>Arius,</hi> the Deacons an <hi>Actius:</hi> and in ſhort there is no Office in the World, Sacred or Civil, but has been in the poſſeſſion of infamous perſons, who have been a reproach and ſcandal to it.</p>
               <p>Now although the paſſions of men move them to be troubleſome in any State or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, yet there are ſome that qualifie them more for Miſchief, and others that diſpoſe them for it: There may be many wicked men that might be willing enough to make a diſturbance, but they may want
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:64435:192"/>parts and Abilities for the work. Any man may pretend to a wicked opinion, but every one cannot recommend it to others; and there are few that care for being He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks by themſelves; But where Malice and an evil temper has the advantage of Natural and acquir'd endowments, like Sulphur and Salt peter, it does not only preſently take fire, but has likewiſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary force and capacity to deſtroy. It is obſerv'd by ſome of the Fathers that moſt of the <hi>Haereſiarchae,</hi> the Authours of Hereſies or Sects,<note place="margin">Aug.

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:64435:193"/>ſuch as rais'd Hereſie, and reckons up par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly all the advantages they had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend themſelves and their Doctrine; and at laſt concludes they were a mighty Temptation, enough almoſt to ſtagger the moſt confirm'd Orthodox Believe:<note place="margin">Vincent.

There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Temper that no Fortune, no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, can content, and render eaſy to it ſelf, or reſtrain from diſturbing the world; but this extravagancy is not Common; and the Generality of men, though not very quiet or peaceable in their Diſpoſitions, yet when they have gain'd their point; and are poſſeſs'd of wealth, and honour, they are commonly willing to ſecure the enjoyment of thoſe Poſſeſſions, by letting things run in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:64435:193"/>courſe: But if one of theſe men hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to labour under repulſe and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, his patience is ſoon at an end. Upon this account many of the Inferiour Clergy that have ſtood in Competition for a Biſhoprick and loſt it, have broken off all Communion with their Biſhops whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors they were; ſo <hi>Novatianus,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others became Hereticks: ſometimes growing impatient with waiting for the Death of their Biſhop, they have revolted againſt him, and drawn the People after them, Thus <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Macedonius</hi> became the heads of Sects; ſometimes deſpair of Promotion after long waiting, and envy againſt thoſe they ſaw preferr'd before them hath carri'd away unſteaddy men, to ſet up for ſingularity, and to make new Sects. Thus <hi>Aetius</hi> Separated from the <hi>Arians,</hi> and taught new Blaſphemies of his own. Sometimes vain men have been carri'd away with the applauſe and favour of the people (that flock'd after them and through'd their Churches) to ſet up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt their Biſhop upon preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of greater intereſt in the people.

               <p>Now as the Biſhops are under the leaſt Temptation to make a diſturbance (and what Governour will raiſe a Sedition againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?)
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:64435:195"/>ſo in fact likewiſe they are ſound to be very few, that being Biſhops have rais'd any Hereſie or Schiſm. Let any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Catalogues of Ancient Hereſies: and Compute how many of the 60 reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> or of the 88. of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> or of the greater number of <hi>Philaſtius,</hi> and the more confus'd account of <hi>Theodoret;</hi> How many of them I ſay were Biſhops when they turn'd Hereticks, and he ſhall find very few if any one in all thoſe numbers. But if any after they had Debauch'd the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their Rightful Paſtors, were by ſubreption made Biſhops of their Party, They were never look'd upon as Biſhops but only as heads of a Faction. So that I believe the reader may by this time eaſily perceive what truth there is in Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s General Charge, that the Biſhops were the cauſes of the Hereſie, and Schiſm, and that it was ſo wonderful a thing that a Hereſie ſhould be begun by one that was no Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Beſides this charge of Hereſie and Schiſm, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> accuſes the Biſhops of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been the cauſe of Church corruptions, and Sedition: As to the firſt, if he means that the Biſhops firſt introduc'd theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions into the Church, I believe he will be never able to prove it: as to the latter we ſhall examine it in due place.</p>
               <p>The Corruptions of Chriſtian Religion whether in Doctrine or Worſhip, have crept unperceivably into the Church; and by ſuch degrees, that it is a hard matter to

Mr. <hi>B.</hi> charges conſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but proves nothing: But the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conjecture I think can be made of the riſe and Progreſs of theſe, is, 1. That moſt of the corruptions in Doctrine crept in together with the Heathen Philoſophy: For great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers eſpecially the followers of <hi>Plato</hi> turning Chriſtians, ſtill retain'd ſomething of their former Notions, which not appearing to be any way prejudicial to Chriſtianityl; but on the Contrary rendering it more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the wiſer part of Heathens, were by degrees own'd among the more learned ſort, in their Diſputations with Heathens, and paſs'd without contradiction: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards buſie men building farther conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences upon this foundation, Improv'd the corruption, till at laſt it grew Groſs and intolerable.

Hence Prayer for the Dead, and the opinion of Purgatory; Hence proceeded many other curious Queſtions about the nature of God and his Attributes, of the Fatal determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of events, of free will and the like. And as to the more ſordid, ſuperſtitious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in Worſhip. If any one ſort of men are to be charg'd with them, I believe the Monks will bid faireſt; The Croſs, and Reliques, that came firſt from <hi>Judea,</hi> are
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:64435:196"/>owing as far a I can obſerve to <hi>Melania</hi> and her Monks;<note place="margin">Paulin Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad. Sulp. Sever.</note> and I do believe the ſtory of the finding of the Croſs is of no ancienter ſtanding. Who has fill'd all the world with fictitious Reliques, and fabulous Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning them? Who Debauch'd the reaſon and common ſenſe of men by their fulſome Legends and fictions of Miracles? By whoſe means in ſhort, had Superſtition overſpread the face of the Chriſtian world? Were not the Monks the manifeſt Authors and Promoters of all this? Superſtition was born and brought up firſt in Monaſteries, and as Monks came into the Church, they brought it along with them, and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the people had of the piety of theſe Retir'd men, made every thing current that they advanc'd? What ſo devoted Inſtruments had the Papal uſurpation, as the Monks, that pretended exemption from the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of their Biſhops, and ſubjected the Epiſcopal Authority to it. And for Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, though the Groſſneſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit were enough to prove it Monkiſh; yet beſides, it is found by matter of fact to be theirs, <hi>Paſchaſius Radbertus</hi> being the firſt that broach'd this Doctrine. All this that I have but juſt mentioned in the General may be made out by a deduction of the riſe and Progreſs of Superſtition; but a particular account would exceed too much the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of this book. This I muſt add, that the Biſhops who are charg'd with theſe Corruptions by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> were the only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:64435:196"/>of them that we find in Antiquity: as we may ſee in the Canons of the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Church, and that of <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Countreys. The firſt Picture we read of in a Chriſtian Church was torn in pieces by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> a Biſhop: the firſt Councils about Images condemn'd the Idolatrous uſe of them with great zeal, but at laſt ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being ſtill advanc'd by the Popularity of the Monks, and the ignorance of the Age, and ſome of the Emperors joyning with them, prevail'd againſt the Biſhops: and ſo Idolatry was brought for a help to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Devotion; And if at laſt the Biſhops joyn'd in the ſuperſtitions, it is no more a wonder, than that they were engag'd in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. For when any number of people are corrupted, whether with ſuperſtition or falſe Doctrine, they will find Teachers to their own mind, not that their Biſhops will comply with every popular wind of doctrine, but becauſe men will make themſelves Paſtors after their own hearts: and as long as there is a Heretick or an Ambitious man who will be any thing for applauſe, or preferment, they will never want Biſhops and heads of their faction; or if the Clergy have no <hi>Judas,</hi> they will find Teachers amongſt themſelves, and give them what Titles they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>The laſt branch of the Charge is <hi>Sedition,</hi> and this is as grievous as any of the other. Suppoſe the matter of fact in the firſt place true, that ſeveral Biſhops had been Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: does this proceed from their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64435:197"/>or any Principle the Biſhops maintain, that is inconſiſtent with the people where they live? This I ſuppoſe cannot be pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Or is Dioceſan Epiſcopacy ſuch an enemy to the peace of the Government? We have had the experience of it for many ages, and find but few that were ſo troubleſome. But becauſe as the caſe ſtands now, we are to reckon only ſince the Reformation (for if a man be not blind he may ſee that this worſhipful Church Hiſtory is only deſign'd againſt Proteſtant Biſhops under a general name) They I ſuppoſe will receive ample Teſtimony from the Government, of their faithfulneſs and Loyalty: How many acts of Oblivion have been made for Biſhops and their Party? Where were they ſeen encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Rebels againſt their Prince with the hopes of Salvation? What Reign have they diſturb'd here with their Seditions? or whoſe Government were they enemies to, unleſs it were that of a <hi>Rebellious piece</hi> of a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> and his Son, the <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> of Mr. <hi>Baxter?</hi> But <hi>Loyalty</hi> has hitherto been the greateſt crime of our Biſhops; and long may they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to <hi>fear God and the King,</hi> more than the Inſolence of any faction; and I pray God they may always preſerve Inviolable that great Treaſure committed to them, and the greateſt next that of the Faith: the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the moſt Loyal Church in the World.</p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:64435:197"/>
               <p>Now although the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſince the Reformation need no defence in this particular, the merit of their Loyalty being ſo well known; and what other Biſhops may do, does not concern us; yet becauſe in this Treatiſe I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the defence of the Primitive Church, and by conſequence of our own, it will be neceſſary to add ſomething upon this ſubject, by way of anſwer to ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has brought together to ſhew the ſeditious Practices of the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing he takes to task,<note place="margin">Treatiſe of Epiſcop. part. c. <hi>22.</hi>
                  </note> is an old Maxim of King <hi>James, no Biſhop no King:</hi> which is repreſented here as if the Biſhops were the Authors of it: <hi>and if the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, had ſay'd no</hi> Prebyters no King: <hi>you would have taken it for Treaſonable, as if they had threatned that the King ſhall not be King unleſs they may have their way, and ſhall not the King be King unleſs you may be Biſhops?</hi> It is well for the Biſhops that none of them was Author of that Dangerous ſaying; elſe I perceive it might bear an impeachment, and prove by little management at leaſt <hi>Conſtructive Treaſon,</hi> but the Authority of a King may excuſe him of Treaſon againſt himſelf, though the Scotch Presbyterians have declared him a Traytor to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and the Holy Kirk: And ſurely that King had ſome reaſon to ſay it, for it is not likely he ſhould paſs ſuch a complement upon the Biſhops, and make them ſo neceſſary to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, if he had not found ſome great
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:64435:198"/>ſuitableneſs in this Church government to that of the State. The truth is that ſaying of King <hi>James</hi> was the Reſult of a long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of a Turbulent, Seditious, ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Presbytery in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and how little he was a King while he was among them the Hiſtorians of thoſe times as <hi>Spotſwood, John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> and others do ſufficiently ſhew: Or if you would have a more particular deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Inſolencies, and enchroachments of that Presbyterian Clergy, look into the <hi>Burden of Iſſcahar,</hi> and you will ſoon find rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough for this Maxim. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> goes about gravely to Confute this, as <hi>an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fiction without proof.</hi>

Suppoſe it is not abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but Kings may be without Biſhops or Presbyters either, what then? Why then King <hi>James</hi> was miſtaken in his Politicks: when he ſaid <hi>No Biſhop no King.</hi> There is no neceſſity of that neither: for all Maxims in Morality and Policy are not to be uſed ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully as to be judged according to the rigour of the letter. He ſpoke this with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his own experience, and his own caſe; and the Anti-Epiſcopal men made his words
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64435:198"/>good, by deſtroying Biſhops firſt, and the King after: when this or that ſort of men is made either neceſſary or deſtructive to government; the meaning is, that either their Principles or Practices, or intereſt, do either ſupport, and aſſure, or elſe overthrow and endanger the State: and that their practices upon all occaſions are generally ſuitable to their principles. This will be clearer by theſe inſtances: Popery is generally look'd upon as a Religion deſtructive of Civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and not without reaſon. Muſt there therefore be no government where there is Popery? The Kingdoms of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> and ſeveral other Countreys do manifeſt the contrary. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are look'd upon as the great Incendiarys of the world, and that no place can be at peace where they have any influence: and yet they are entertain'd in all Popiſh Countries: Is the general charge therefore of Sedition againſt theſe falſe and groundleſs? No ſuch matter. Suppoſe then among Chriſtians one ſhould ſay with regard to us, <hi>no Proteſtants no King.</hi> I ſuppoſe there would be no ſuch mighty abſurdity in it. Therefore if the Principles of thoſe that were Anti-Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, were look'd upon by that wiſe King as Anti-Monarchical too: and the Doctrine of the Biſhops was much more ſafe to the Government; it was ground enough for the ſaying. And now to vindicate thoſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Biſhops from the imputation of Sedition, that he has charg'd in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64435:199"/>with deſturbing the Church and the world.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing Mr. <hi>B.</hi> lays to the charge of Biſhops is the Uſurpation of Popiſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy: <hi>Do you not know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that where Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy is at the higheſt, there Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors have been at the loweſt? Do you not know, how the Papal Prelacy at preſent uſurpeth one part of their Government, and is ready to take away the other when ever Kings diſpleaſe them?</hi> &amp;c. Is it the Biſhop or the Papiſt that is here to blame? Is this the effect of their Order, or of thoſe pernicious principles they have inbib'd? If it was the fault of the Biſhops, then we muſt find the ſame practice in other Ages; or if the Popiſh Biſhops are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to Government, are their Presbyters leſs to be fear'd? The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> before our Civil Wars us'd all the intereſt they had to prevent ſending of Popiſh Biſhops into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> It was not I ſuppoſe out of any great affection to us, or regard to the Peace of the Kingdom, but becauſe they thought Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops unneceſſary, ſince Prieſts and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> could do more miſchief without them. But the ſame reaſon that renders. Popiſh Prieſts and Biſhops ſo dangerous to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, renders the Presbyterians ſo too: But firſt let us examine Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s inſtances of more ancient Epiſcopal Sedition.</p>
               <p>The firſt is at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the time of <hi>Theophilus</hi> and <hi>Cyril,</hi> which I have conſider'd already. I need ſay no more here than, 1. That the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> of all the people in the world were the moſt infamous for
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:64435:199"/>Sedition, even before they ever had any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. 2. That their Biſhops did never give any countenance or encouragement to their Sedition. The next is the combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> about <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> where <hi>Theophilus</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> were concern'd: To this I Anſwer, 1. That theſe Biſhops were indeed the occaſion, but never intended this tumult, or gave their party any incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make this diſturbance. 2. That what they did, although it was very unjuſt, yet it was not done againſt the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but in complyance with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. 3. That thoſe who began this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny were ſuch as favoured <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> but did it againſt his will, and againſt all his intreaties and obſervations to the contrary: for he conveyed himſelf away firſt of all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to prevent a mutiny: and in the whole buſineſs he behaved himſelf ſo as to indeavour by all means to prevent any miſchief. He ſaw the civil power was wrongfully againſt him, and he would not contend, but indeavoured to ſteal away to prevent contention.</p>
               <p>The ſtory of <hi>Theophilus</hi> his charging <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> with double Letters, that whoever was Conqueror, he might apply himſelf to him in his name, is of the ſame piece with the reſt of <hi>Socrates</hi> his ſtory concerning that Biſhop; and in all probability an invention of one of the Monks of <hi>Nitria.</hi> He would never have diſobliged that man afterwards after ſuch a manner, that he had intruſted
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64435:200"/>with ſuch a ſecret. Upon this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes a great outcry: <hi>What would have been ſaid of one of us now, if we had not only complyed with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Tyrant, but alſo juggled with preſents and double Letters before hand: I did my ſelf diſown</hi> Oliver Cromwel <hi>openly to his death:</hi> So did <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> So did the <hi>Levellers.</hi> So did the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as far as they durſt, and none of theſe out of any great affection to their Prince: but becauſe they ſaw things run againſt their inclination: and theſe had the ſame quarrel againſt <hi>Cromwel</hi> they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againſt the King: <hi>i. e.</hi> they could not indure to ſee the power in any other hands than their own. But whatever Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had with <hi>Cromwel to his death:</hi> It ſeems he generouſly forgets it after his death. And compares the moſt barbarous villain in the World to King <hi>David</hi> in his Epiſtle to his Son. But as for his owning his Son <hi>Richard Cromwel,</hi> becauſe it was given out that he was a <hi>Cavalier in his heart,</hi> will ſurely find excuſe as far as it finds belief.</p>
               <p>The next thing is the Biſhops too ſudden owning the Barbarian Conquerors. <hi>Do I need to recite</hi> (ſayes Mr. <hi>B.</hi>) <hi>how great</hi> Leo <hi>himſelf and other Roman and Italian Biſhops, owned the Barbarian Conquerors? No wonder then if they too early took</hi> Theodoricus <hi>for their King, ſet over them by God, who was a better man than the reſt, and had at laſt a better Title.</hi> The truth is, it is not <hi>neceſſary</hi> for you <hi>to recite</hi> this at all: becauſe I think their lyes no neceſſity upon any man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64435:200"/>that which is not true. For how I pray did great <hi>Leo</hi> himſelf own the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Conqueror?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. ad An. <hi>461.</hi>
                  </note> Or who were thoſe that he owned? <hi>Theodoricus?</hi> But <hi>Leo.</hi> was dead a long while before, in the year 461. as <hi>Baronius;</hi> or the year before, as the Chronicle of <hi>Marcellinus</hi> fixes it: whereas <hi>Theodoricus</hi> did not invade <hi>Itadly</hi> till the year 490: Was it <hi>Attila</hi> that he owned? He was indeed a Barbarian Conqueror in <hi>Leo</hi>'s time: But how did he own him? <hi>Attilas,</hi> when he had laid all <hi>Italy</hi> waſt, and was come with his Army before <hi>Rome,</hi> this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is ſaid to have gone out to him:<note place="margin">Suid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſiod. Chron.</note> 
                  <hi>Miſſu</hi> Valentiniani <hi>Imperatoris,</hi> ſent by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and prevailed with him to raiſe the Seige and leave <hi>Italy.</hi> If this be owning Barbarian Conquerors, they were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable that would find fault. So <hi>Lupus Trecaſſenſis, Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Milan, Severinus,</hi> and ſeveral other Biſhops of that time, prevailed with ſeveral of thoſe Barbarous Conquerors, to uſe their victory with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; and by their interceſſion ſaved the lives and fortunes of many thouſands, But that they flattered theſe Kings, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of their Titles, we do not find. But however <hi>Leo</hi> may eſcape, the <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops <hi>too early took.</hi> Theodoricus <hi>for their King.</hi> How does Mr. <hi>B.</hi> conclude that it was <hi>too early.</hi> Had they then any rightful Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour whoſe cauſe they might maintain againſt this Uſurper? the Weſtern Empire was now extinct, and not ſo much as the Title
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:64435:201"/>remain'd after <hi>Auguſtulus: Odoacer</hi> had no Title but his Sword, and the poſſeſſion of 13 or 14 years. The Eaſtern Emperor, if he had any right, he had given it to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doricus,</hi> whom he adopted,<note place="margin">Jornand. de Reb. Get c. <hi>57.</hi> adamplian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem ejus, in arma ſibi e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umifilium adoptavit &amp;c. Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it quae po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcebat, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſit ei po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendans Rowanum.</note> and ſent into <hi>Italy</hi> to drive <hi>Odoacer</hi> out thence? So that if Conqueſt; or reſignation can give a Title, this King had a ſufficient one. And beſides all this, the Weſtern Empire was at that time in ſuch a confuſion, what by facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within themſelves, what by invaſion of Strangers, that it was a very hard matter to know who had the right; there being no Law of Succeſſion eſtabliſhed, and <hi>Theodoſuis</hi> his line being extinct. So that this is no paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with our late Rebellion, when there was a lawful King, of ancient deſent, whoſe right did not depend upon any election of the people: to raiſe War againſt ſuch a one, and to put him to death, and own the fact, and extol the barbarous Uſurper, is ſuch an inſtance not to be parallel'd by any Nation, and ſuch as no Chriſtian Sect or Profeſſion, out of Popery could have own'd or juſtified, but that of our tender conſcience <hi>Loyal Proteſtant Diſſenters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place we have the ſtory of <hi>Theophilus</hi> and the Monks of <hi>Nitrià</hi> which no reaſonable man can believe as it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> without loving a malicious lye. The reaſons I have given in another place, and do not think it very convenient to repeat them as often as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does the ſtory: But this is added by way
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:64435:201"/>of obſervation. <hi>Did ever Presbyterians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian, Inhuman villany as this, by ſuch falſe diſſimulation and Malice?</hi> Yes much more, by the Covenant. Who preached up Rebellion under pretence of Religion? And deſtroyed the King under pretence of fighting for him? Who ſold their Maſter when they had promiſed to protect him? Were not theſe <hi>Presbyterians?</hi> But becauſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſeems now to have gone over to the <hi>Independents,</hi> he knows much worſe can be ſaid of them. I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon this much againſt my inclination, being forc'd upon it by the confidence of our Author, than which nothing can be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking; <hi>quis tulerit Gracchos de Seditione querentes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next inſtance is that of <hi>Euſebius Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſatenus,</hi> who when <hi>Valens</hi> his Officer had brought him an Order for his Baniſhment,<note place="margin">Theod. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> tells him, <hi>If the people ſhould know it, they would drown him in the-river</hi> Euphrates: <hi>What would they ſay if our Churches were ſuch, as this Orthodox Epiſcopal Church was?</hi> What ever they would ſay of the people, they muſt needs commend your Miniſters. But the caſe is very much alter'd. Here a Biſhop leaves his people, rather than occaſion any diſorder: With you the Paſtors perſwade the people that notwithſtanding all the laws to the contrary, they muſt not deſert their Paſtors. Here the People were incenſed with the apprehenſion of <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew the Foundation of the Faith; with
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:64435:202"/>you there is no ſuch reaſon, ſince you all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs we are agreed in the Subſtantials of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and yet the Teachers preſs their Congregatios to ſtand by them againſt the Government. Here a good Biſhop would not be prevailed upon by any intreaties to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn againſt the Emperors command, to the manifeſt endangering of the publick peace; and deſire them to have patience, and ſubmit to Authority: The <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> Teachers when they had opportunity, did inflame the people againſt the Government, and by their ſeditious preaching kindled the late Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. What would we ſay then, if you were like this Church of <hi>Samoſata,</hi> that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Biſhop, and would be govern'd by him, and take his advice when he diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from tumult and ſedition? We would ſay then that, tho' the firſt heats were not warantable, yet that you would be much better than you are, and the Government could be much more ſecure of you than it is.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> purſues this inſtance farther, and adds,<note place="margin">Theod. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>When the Emperors Arian Biſhop was ſet over them, not one of all the people would come to the Church as they were uſed to do: Would not waſh in the ſame water,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>do our hearers deal as harſhly as this?</hi> How ſhall a man deal with thoſe that have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but againſt Ceremonies, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy? Is there any reſemblance between our caſe and this? The <hi>Arians</hi> (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> confeſſes) deny'd by direct conſequence the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:64435:202"/>Being of Chriſt; and is it any wonder that Orthodox Believers ſhould have ſuch abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theſe men? If any of our Biſhops, Nay, if an Angel from Heaven ſhould preach ſuch Doctrine as this, let him be <hi>Anathema,</hi> and be abhorr'd as much as you pleaſe. In the mean time they are but in evil caſe, that depend upon the Authority of your inſtances for Separation, and will believe they are moderate Men, becauſe they do not uſe <hi>Orthodox rightful Biſhops</hi> as harſhly, as the Orthodox did the <hi>Arian</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers; Although they have no great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to boaſt of their civility upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it being eaſy to ſhew out of their writings, and Sermons, (to ſay nothing of their common converſation) ſuch Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as a Chriſtian ought to be aſhamed of: But theſe good men are too much mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to bluſh, and keep their blood ſo much in ſubjection, that they never ſuffer it upon any provocation to fluſh into their faces.</p>
               <p>After this we have another ſtory of <hi>the Virgins that ſung in reproach of</hi> Julian <hi>the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate: Who can help Libels,<note place="margin">Theod. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>13.</hi>

               <p>Preſently we have another ſtory of the Church of <hi>Edeſſa</hi> that would aſſemble, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Emperors commands to the contrary. And what is all this to the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64435:203"/>purpoſe? Did not the Primitive Chriſtians do ſo too, and ſuffer'd Martyrdom for it? But did they ever enter into Covenants, and Practices againſt the State? No, here is mention of a poor Woman that made haſt to the Aſſembly when ſhe knew it would be diſturb'd by Souldiers, and in probability be maſſacred: but what to do? to ſee how manfully a field Conventicle would be have it ſelf, or to plunder the Baggage of the aſſailants, when they ſhould be put to the rout? No ſuch thing: but with a deſign to ſuffer Martyrdom, and to dye tamely with the reſt, for the profeſſion of the Faith.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>We have</hi> Baſil<hi>'s anſwer to the Prefect,</hi>

For when your circumſtances are the ſame with <hi>Baſils,</hi> I believe you may follow his example; and they are unreaſonable men that will find fault, that when any King or Emperors fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>your upon Earth is offered you upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:64435:203"/>to betray the Faith, you ſhould reject it with indignation. But the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſubſtance, and indifferent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Religion, ſtrangely alters the caſe. There is a great deal more to this effect; of the Orthodox refuſing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to and keeping ſeparate aſſemblies from the <hi>Arians;</hi> which as they do not prove Sedition againſt thoſe that were then <hi>Non conformiſts,</hi> ſo they do not excuſe ours. And this muſt be added, that in all theſe lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſtractions of the Church we find no Orthodox Biſhop animate the people againſt the government, what perſecution ſoever they ſuffer'd; but on the contrary, reſtraining all Tendencies to Rebellion, and withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves when the Popular favour towards them grew inordinate and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable; whereas too many of our Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Presbyters have kindled and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Sedition.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Audas a Biſhop in</hi> Perſia <hi>demoliſh'd</hi> their <hi>Temple or Pyreum by violence, for which the Emperor of</hi> Perſia <hi>kill'd him,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Novatians <hi>were Epiſcopal, and ſo were the</hi> Donatiſts (ſays Mr. <hi>B.</hi>) <hi>and yet how have they been judged of for their Schiſm I need not tell:</hi> They are very much to blame
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:64435:205"/>that ſay the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Independents</hi> troubl'd the Primitive Church: It was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to be troubleſome before they were at all, it ſeems all the Sects, and Schiſms of that time thought they had no right to pretend to be a Church, unleſs they had Biſhops: But theſe <hi>Anti-Epiſcopal Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts</hi> were reſerved, it ſeems for the laſt times, as the ſevereſt curſe, and judgment that could befal the Church.

               <p>Beſides theſe Epiſcopal Schiſmaticks, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> gives a ſmall liſt of Biſhops that were Anti-Hereticks. <hi>Apollinaris, father and ſon, Paulus Samoſatenus, Neſtorius, Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia, Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Mopſueſtia, have been Arch-Hereticks, and the cauſe of Tumults and Diſſenſion.</hi> There is much of this that is not true, and ſome of it that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does not believe to be ſo: For 1. <hi>Apollinaris</hi> the Father was no Biſhop;<note place="margin">Hieron de Script.

Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> the younger is ſaid to have been a Biſhop by <hi>Philoſtorgius,</hi> though <hi>Photius</hi> adds that he knows not whence he had it: But <hi>Jerom</hi> is expreſs, and that is the Common opinion. Yet whether he were the Author of this Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie or his father, he was a Heretick before he was a Biſhop, while he was yet reader of the

                  </note> and from <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> writing againſt his Hereſie, it is plain that it was long before the younger <hi>Apollinaris</hi> was made Biſhop (if ever he were ſo.) <hi>Nicephorus</hi> makes the repulſe of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaris</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> (which ſeems to be after he may be preſum'd to have been Biſhop from ſome expreſſions of that Hiſtorian,<note place="margin">Niceph. l. <hi>12.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note>) to have been the occaſion of his Hereſie; but this manifeſtly contradicts, all ancienter Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians; and indeed the very ſtory contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts it ſelf; for <hi>Flavian</hi> upon the place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victs him of having been a Heretick before: <hi>Sandius</hi> thinks he was not Biſhop of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi> till after the Council of <hi>C.

The ſame he does with <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> He was on their ſide againſt the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils that condemn'd them; but now from Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate he is turn'd Accuſer: <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedia</hi> was no Heretick in the judgment of <hi>Valeſius:</hi> but if he were, he was not an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick: becauſe he did not begin the arch-Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, but followed <hi>Arius.

               <p>After this we have little hints of quarrels which were far enough from Sedition, as that of <hi>Theodotus</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> and of <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> the former was a particular hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and had no conſequence.

He might have ſaid to his Monks, that the people muſt ſtand by them; and conſidering his Learning and Eloquence, he might have preſum'd to have edified more in a Coventicle than the Biſhop could in the Church; yet this good man had in humbler opinion of his gifts, than to endanger the peace of the Church, rather than forbear the exerciſe of them: And after a long Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſilence, he was not grown ſo reſty and Irreconcileable, but that when his Church, was threatned by the <hi>Arian</hi> Peſt, he return'd voluntarily to aſſiſt his Biſhop without deſiring the Church Walls (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Order and Diſcipline of it) to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down that he might enter Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly like a Conquerour.

The Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> I ſuppoſe was not in ſuch want as to be forc'd to charge the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of their Religion with ſo great a truſt, nor could they have been ſo abſurd as to commit their cauſe to ſuch hands as they could not be aſſur'd of, and they could not think they would be ſo acceptable to a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Chriſtian Emperor, who had ſo lately put out ſuch ſevere Edicts againſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſuperſtition. It ſhews a ſtrange temper when a man to render Biſhops odious will not ſtick to raiſe falſe accuſations againſt Chriſtians, and charge them with the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heathens. <hi>In the worſt,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>B. Good</hi> Ambroſe <hi>at</hi> Milan <hi>(was not ſilenc'd as we are) but by an Orthodox Emperor deſir'd and Commanded to deliver the Arians poſſeſſion but of one Church and he refus'd to do it and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake that Church. &amp;c.

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:64435:208"/>there is great reaſon to value the peacable Reſignation of the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> when we conſider by what Uſurpation and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they were brought in; and what a number of worthy Learned Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were turned out to make vacancies for theſe Men who were to inſtruct the people in new Myſteries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which their old Paſtours had not the Conſcience, or ability to Teach them, that is of the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have ſeveral other inſtances of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his zeal againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> and ſome of his Charity in reſcuing ſome of them from the fury of the multitude, of his popularity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But not a word of his ſedition, or his forcible reſiſtance of the Emperour: The harſheſt thing he did, was the ſhutting of the Church againſt the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Emperour, who would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it to the <hi>Arians</hi> for a place to Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme Chriſt, under pretence of Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him.</p>
               <p>But at length, after long ſtraining Mr. <hi>B.</hi> has found out ſome Biſhops in the ſame fault, of owning and flattering Tyrants, and Uſurpers, with himſelf, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is home to the purpoſe, and ſeems to parallel his Dedications to <hi>R.

                  <hi>And becauſe the late Revolutions in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>are made by ſome Prelates. The pretence

               <p>How like <hi>Cromwel</hi> was to <hi>Maximus</hi> I do not find by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> though he deſires <hi>it ſhould be Noted:</hi> They were both Uſurpers, but as unlike in their circumſtances, as they could well be imagined.

And had he been contented with his firſt conqueſt, it is not likely <hi>Theodoſius</hi> had ever arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him: But <hi>Cromwel,</hi> as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred without any colour of right according to the conſtitution of this Kingdom, ſo while he enjoyed it, the right Heir was ſtill in being, to whom he and all the people in Conſcience ſtill owed Allegiance, and whoſe intereſt the invincible Loyalty of ſome of his ſubjects did ſtill promote, and therefore they were not ſo excuſable that complyed with this Tyrant, as thoſe that cloſed with <hi>Maximus.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Maximus</hi> did pretend ſomething of Title by Deſcent, as being related to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great.<note place="margin">Baron. An. <hi>383.1.</hi>
                  </note> But <hi>Cromwel</hi> never pretended to be of the Royal Family: So that here was a vaſt difference between theſe two perſons before us. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> can find no difference but this, <hi>That</hi> Maximus <hi>ſtudied to pleaſe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and riſe by them, and not by the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi> If there had been any Sectaries in thoſe dayes of the ſame Principles, with ſome of ours; He underſtood his intereſt too well
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:64435:210"/>to have neglected them. But how is it the Biſhops fault, that <hi>he ſtudied to pleaſe them?</hi> That <hi>he ſtudied to riſe by them,</hi> is more than any body has ſaid before Mr. <hi>B.</hi> And if <hi>Maximus</hi> had ſuch a deſign upon the Biſhops, he was ſurely diſappointed; for we do not find any where, that any Biſhop did ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute in the leaſt to the raiſing of him. But beſides to what would he riſe? He was Emperour already, before we find him take the leaſt notice of the Biſhops: And if after this ſucceſs of his Army, to eſtabliſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his new conqueſt, he indeavoured to oblige all ſorts of people, and amongſt the reſt, the Biſhops, who were popular men in thoſe dayes; I cannot underſtand, how it can be any great reproach to them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wicked Men may reverence that Vertue and goodneſs in others, that they will not practiſe themſelves Sometimes their guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Conſciences, and their juſt fear of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, makes them ſtand in awe of men of ſevere converſation, and to indeavour to pleaſe them. Sometimes their intereſt leads them to oblige thoſe that have any influence or Authority over the people: And one would think this would hardly be objected by way of reproach to them that innocently received the obligation. Well, But what did this Uſurper do to pleaſe the Biſhops? And how far were they inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to his advancement? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells us, <hi>When</hi> Gratian <hi>the Emperour befriended the Priſcillianiſts;</hi> Maximus <hi>to pleaſe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:64435:210"/>perſecuted them to death:</hi> But by this, if he pleaſed ſome Biſhops, he diſpleaſed ſeveral others, who were extreamly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with theſe proceedings; although they all were of opinion thoſe Hereticks were not fit to live:<note place="margin">Sulp.

                  </note> I will give a brief account of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> his negotiation with him. When <hi>Maximus</hi> had ſeiſed that part of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Empire that <hi>Gratian</hi> was poſſeſſed of, <hi>Valentinian,</hi> fearing leſt the Tyrant ſhould invade his Countries, ſends St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to mediate a peace: <hi>Maximus</hi> having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that <hi>Valentinian</hi> was making ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations againſt him, and had entertained the <hi>Huns</hi> and other Auxiliaries, began to incline to an accommodation, looking upon the Invaſion of <hi>Italy</hi> as too hazardous an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: Therefore he ſent ſome of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:64435:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>to meet <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and to offer him a peace; which afterwards was concluded upon theſe Terms: That <hi>Maximus</hi> ſhould be owned Emperour, and retain all the Countries he was poſſeſſed of: This was the firſt Embaſſy of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in which negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was not ſo much to do Honour to <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> as out of fear of <hi>Gratians</hi> prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that <hi>Maximus</hi> did forbear invading <hi>Italy.</hi> But when this Uſurper perceived that <hi>Valentinians</hi> affairs were not in ſo good a poſture as he imagined at firſt, he was vexed that he had let ſo fair an opportunity ſlip, of adding the Dominions of <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> to his other Conqueſts. Upon this, he begins to pick quarrels with <hi>Valentinian,</hi> to take the part of the Orthodox Biſhops, nay of the Heathens, and every one that had reaſon of diſcontent, calling himſelf <hi>Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorem Reipublicae. Valentinian</hi> jealous of his deſigns, ſends <hi>Ambroſe</hi> a ſecond time, to deſire <hi>Gratians</hi> body, and likely to ſound <hi>Maximus.</hi> This good Biſhop was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this time but very coldly: The U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper reproached him with having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon him before, and keeping him out of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Biſhop replyed, that it was not he, but his own fears that prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him: and in ſhort, when <hi>Ambroſe</hi> would not communicate with him nor his Biſhops, becauſe he looked upon him as a man of blood; He was ſent back without having been able to effect any thing, and with no better anſwer than that <hi>Maximus</hi>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:64435:212"/>would conſider of it. This is the ſumm of this negotiation, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Paulinus</hi> in his life, gives an account of it. And now if any diſloyalty can be ſuſpected in <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and the Orthodox Biſhops, it muſt be ſuch a ſecret as was never yet reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Whereas nothing is more evident from theſe Relations, than the integrity of that Biſhop, and his extraordinary affection towards his Prince and Country. For from what has been already ſaid we may obſerve, 1. That <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was not only a dutiful Subject, but as himſelf ſayes, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vanity, the Father or Guardian of his Prince. 2. The confidence his Prince had in his integrity, when after ſo great and freſh Provocations he would truſt him with his life and Empire, and that although he had been provoked in the moſt tender part, by his Princeſs indeavours for the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Arianiſm. Others perhaps if they had been in his condition, would have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this Tyrants declaring for the Truth, as ſuch an opportunity that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had offered for the preſervation of the Faith: and ſince the Empreſs was of a falſe Religion, and the Emperour was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by her, why ſhould no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> they ſet up this <hi>Maximus</hi> as the Protector of the true Faith? But <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and the Biſhops were of another mind. They knew what it was to Dye for their Religion, but did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what it was to brigue, or to reſiſt.</p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:64435:212"/>
               <p>I have thus far obſerv'd with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> what this Uſurper <hi>Maximus</hi> did in favour of the Biſhops, how he ſtudied to pleaſe and riſe by them. The next thing we ought to enquire after is, what ſucceſs his Deſign upon the Biſhops produced, and whether they anſwer'd his kindneſſes, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming any intereſt to ſupport his Pretenſions, or by declaring in his favour.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> gives a full account of it in theſe words, <hi>and the ſaid</hi> Maximus, <hi>and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops did ſo cloſe, that only one</hi> Hyginus <hi>a Biſhop is mention'd, and</hi> Theognoſtus, <hi>beſides</hi> Ambroſe <hi>and</hi> Martin, <hi>that rejected</hi> Maximus. I ſhall grant Mr. <hi>B.</hi> here more than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. The truth is, that even thoſe Biſhops that he ſays rejected <hi>Maximus,</hi> did Really own him for Emperor, as having all the Confirmation the Laws of that time did require: and it is a miſtake of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where he tells us that <hi>Ambroſe would not Communicate with the Biſhops becauſe they own'd</hi> Maximus, whereas all the quarrel of St. <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Theognoſtus</hi> was againſt his proceedings with the <hi>Priſcillianiſts,</hi> and his Murdering of <hi>Gratian,</hi> if he Murder'd him. But for all that they own'd him to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, as much as thoſe did that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with him. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> would not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with <hi>Theodoſius</hi> upon the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: but never diſown'd his Authority, as Emperor all that while; what <hi>Hyginus</hi> did, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> cannot tell without Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he was banniſh'd by <hi>Maximus</hi> (as
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:64435:213"/>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tells us,) but the Reaſon is not expreſs'd. Well then: if all this be true, Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s. Obſervation will be ſo too; <hi>That Biſhops can comply with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers that will be for them, as well as Presbyters.</hi> What they <hi>can</hi> do is not our Queſtion, but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Maximus</hi> I am ſure does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in them any great inclination to it, for how I pray did theſe Biſhops comply with that Uſurper? Were any of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to his Advancement? did they Preach up his cauſe, and the lawfulneſs of his Revolt? Did they ever preſs the people to bring in their Plate, and Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Or after his ſucceſſes and the Murder of <hi>Gratian,</hi> did any of theſe Biſhops juſtifie the Uſurpers Proceedings, and preach and print in defence of that Barbarous Regicide? did they flatter him as the Preſerver of Religion, the <hi>David,</hi> the Champion of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> I believe one much better vers'd in Antiquity than Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will find it a hard task to find out any Books, or Dedications of Biſhops to this effect: But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> can tell who Printed, and Preach'd, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered ſubſcriptions, for the Approbation of the moſt execrable Regicide committed under the Sun: and others can ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, though at preſent it is not neceſſary to be particular. Well: But as to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops that own'd <hi>Maximus,</hi> what ſort of compliance was theirs? What did they do ſo much in favour of the Uſurper? When he had Conquer'd the Countrys where they
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:64435:213"/>liv'd, and been own'd by both the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Reigning, then they ſubmitted to him; that is, they did not think themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to Rebel, or to ſtir up the People againſt him; that was none of their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and therefore they meddled not with it. And in ſhort, we do not find they ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died any other complyance than only to be quiet and to do their own buſineſs. Some of them indeed deſir'd his aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>Priſcillianiſts;</hi> ſo might Biſhops have deſired <hi>Cromwel</hi> to ſupreſs <hi>Ranters, Seekers, Adamites,</hi> and ſuch like, that were not only a Reproach to Chriſtian Religion, but to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society: and yet I do believe ſuch an Addreſs would hardly have been interpreted by the ſtricteſt Royaliſt for a Criminal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with the Uſurper. Moſt of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in <hi>Maximus</hi> his Dominon communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, you will ſay; and that goes a little farther. I do not ſee what great hurt there was in all this: what if he pretended to be Penitent? what if he excus'd it as well as he could, by pretending he was forc'd by the Souldiers? I believe <hi>Ambroſe</hi> did not ſcruple his Communion at firſt, and he ſeems to hint as much; but upon his ſecond Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy he found him to be a bloody Aſpiring man, and then would have nothing to do with him or any that adhered to him; which he might yet do with greater freedom and decence than thoſe that were his Subjects, becauſe <hi>Ambroſe</hi> belong'd to another Prince, and own'd him only in Titular Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:64435:214"/>with his own Maſter. And now let the Reader judge by this, inſtance how the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops comply'd with Uſurpers, and how like the caſe of <hi>Maximus</hi> and his Biſhops, is to that of <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Adherents and flatterers.</p>

Many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, being ſtill Gentiles, had prevail'd with <hi>Eugenius</hi> to furniſh the expence of the publick Sacrifices, as it was uſed to be in former times: <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who had prevented this indignity to Chriſtian Religion under <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> was earneſtly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by his friends, to try his Authority
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:64435:214"/>with <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who was newly ſet up by the Army; with much unwillingneſs he at laſt undertook it. He gives him the Title of Emperor, and ſuch Title as the condition of thoſe times afforded, this <hi>Engenius</hi> had; being ſet up by the Army which had been in poſſeſſion of the right of making Emperors for ſeveral ages. But though he were an Uſurper, yet there is no flattery in uſing the common Stile to him; ſo <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> calls <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi>

                  <hi>Pious,</hi> when he knew him to be an Idolater. St. <hi>Paul</hi> owns a reſpect due to the High Prieſt, although the office was Abrogated by our Saviours Prieſthood, and the Jewiſh Prieſts were now Uſurpers. So <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes, when they have occaſion to write to the Pope, are fain to uſe the Stile of his <hi>Holineſs;</hi> and yet by that Title are not to be underſtood to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Uſurpations. So <hi>Ambroſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed his Epiſtle, Clementiſſimo Imperatori Eugenio.</hi> But does not he flatter him with theſe Expreſſions, <hi>ſedulitas Poteſtati debita?</hi> This is but a poor Complement; and own'd no farther than in general Terms; <hi>Honour,</hi> where <hi>Honour.</hi> But does not he profeſs he Honours him? He ſays indeed, when he was a private man he had reſpect for him, and ſhould not he now pay it when he was Emperor? This queſtion I believe is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Artificial; and us'd on purpoſe becauſe he would not ſpeak out: as we may ſay by the words following, <hi>ſed qui vobis deferri vultis, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I hope Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will find no Reaſon to tax me of any diſingenuity in this Extract, for I have not torn pieces of ſentences, and conceal'd any thing that might give words a more favourable Conſtruction; but I muſt confeſs it is with great Reluctance that I have been able to do it at all: And ſince Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himſelf refers to them, and compares them with <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Epiſtle, and endeavours to juſtifie them by hinting at other inſtances, I could not avoid giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome account of them. I have promis'd to make no Inferences, <hi>Malicious,</hi> or <hi>not Malicious</hi> from them, but as to the occaſion that has brought in all this, I muſt crave leave to ſhew him, beſides the expreſſions, a great difference between theſe Epiſtles and that
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:64435:218"/>he compar'd them with. For that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by importunity, theſe are volunteer ſervices to an Uſurper. <hi>Eugenius</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten twice to <hi>Ambroſe</hi> before he would make any anſwer; and then he owns ſuch a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, that unleſs the Honour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, threatned by the Reſtauration of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, had requir'd it of him, he would not then have been prevail'd with to have made any Applications to him: although there had paſs'd an aquaintance and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between them, when <hi>Eugenius</hi> was a Private man: But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was a ſtranger to <hi>R. Cromwel,</hi> and had no great temptation to dedicate books to him, nor any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hopes that the <hi>Protector</hi> would ever read this Epiſtle. In ſhort, if I were as worthy to adviſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as he was to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe <hi>Cromwel,</hi> I would ſay it were much more adviſeable for a Chriſtian (eſpecially for one that thinks he is <hi>ſo near his Eternal State,</hi>) to repent and cry <hi>peccavimus</hi> with the Biſhops in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> whom he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Unchriſtianly derides, than to ſtand upon juſtification of the fact, and think to face it out by comparing himſelf with them that were ſo unlike him in all their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>This odious, unpleaſant work is no ſooner done, but Mr. <hi>B.</hi> leads me into a ſubject much more Invidious, by his charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late Rebellion upon the Biſhops and their Party.</p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:64435:219"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this I muſt</hi> add (ſays Mr. <hi>B.</hi>) <hi>ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, That it has been the Biſhops themſelves, that have been the grand cauſe of our Church Diviſions and Separations. What advantage they have given the Separatiſts I have ſhewed before: I am ſure in the Congregation where I once was Teacher, and the Country about, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ever came to paſs, has ſo inclin'd the people to avoid the Prelates, as their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially the ſilencing, and Reproaching their Ancient Teachers, whom they knew longer and better than the Prelates did:</hi> and to ſay truth, the people generally are very Competent judges of their Paſtors. But if the Biſhops have been the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> the <hi>Grand cauſe</hi> of our diviſions, how came it to paſs that when the Biſhops were gone, that theſe diviſions increas'd? in other evils, when you remove the <hi>Grand cauſe,</hi> there follows abatement of the diſtemper: This ſtrange diſeaſe of ſeparation grows more incurable by removing the cauſe. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaith, the reproaching and <hi>Silencing</hi> of the ancient Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters gave offence, and made the Biſhops odious. If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> means that which was done after his Majeſties Reſtauration: it will be an eaſie matter to anſwer, There were many of thoſe Miniſters that were Uſurpers, and had intruded into the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of other men, who had been ſilenc'd, and caſt out by thoſe powers that had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be jealous of honeſt men. There were many others that were intruders into the Miniſtry, and ſuch not a few of them
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:64435:219"/>as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himſelf would not have thought fit to have continued. All the reſt were ſuch as would not ſubmit to the Rule that was then Eſtabliſht in the Church, but choſe rather to leave their Livings, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops could not help it any other wiſe than as they were Members of Parliament; for it was the Law that tied them to that choice, and not the Biſhops. If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> means what happen'd before the laſt Civil Wars; as 'tis likely he may becauſe that follows next, then theſe <hi>Ancient Teachers</hi> that he ſpeaks of, howſoever they might be qualified otherwiſe, were the inſtruments of an Anti-Monarchical, Anti Epiſcopal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. They would preach but they would not conform to the Eſtabliſht Religion. Nay many of them would Preach againſt it, and againſt their Governours too; and Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate the pople from them by their Sermons. Theſe were ſuch Incendiaries as no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have endured. And what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men ſeveral of them were may be obſerv'd from the Regiſter of <hi>Norwich:</hi> where,<note place="margin">Heyl. Life of Land, p. <hi>291.</hi>
                  </note> of four perſons who were inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted preaching, <hi>one was by Trade a</hi> Draper, <hi>another a</hi> Weaver, <hi>and a third a</hi> Taylor: and perhaps not altogether ſo learned as the <hi>Weavers</hi> and <hi>Plowmen</hi> of <hi>Kidderminſter,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>B.</hi> vouches of Abilities not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to moſt of the Ancient Fathers. Yet by <hi>Silencing</hi> of theſe, ſaith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> the Biſhops <hi>caus'd ſeparation.</hi> It is pity the people ſhould know no better than to follow ſuch
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:64435:220"/>men as theſe out of the Church: but if there be ſuch an abſolute neceſſity that theſe men muſt preach I ſhould think they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Conventicle much better than a Church.</p>
               <p>In the next place Mr. <hi>B.</hi> gives us a new account of the original of the late Wars: and affirms <hi>that it was a Parliament of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals and Eraſtians, and not of Presbyterians, who firſt took up Arms in</hi> England <hi>againſt the King.</hi> It is well the Biſhops had no ſhare in it. But pray where were the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> when this Parliament took up Arms, were they not yet in being? Or were there none of them in the Houſe? Or did they Proteſt againſt the proceedings of thoſe <hi>Epiſcopals</hi> and <hi>Eraſtians?</hi> As many of them as were of the Parliament I hope conſented to the taking up of Arms; and it may be, may give Mr. <hi>B.</hi> little thanks for depriving them of the glory of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the <hi>Eraſtians</hi> I have not much to ſay; but that at laſt they outwitted the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> although in the beginning they were reckon'd all one. But can Mr. <hi>B.</hi> believe (or think any body elſe ſo weak as to be impos'd upon in a matter ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) that <hi>it was a Parliament of Epiſcopals and Eraſtians, and not Presbyterians; that began the like War?</hi> were they <hi>Epiſcopals</hi> that voted down Epiſcopacy, Root and Branch before the war was begun? Were they <hi>Epiſcopals</hi> that Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd the King at <hi>York</hi> for <hi>Reformation in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline and Worſhip? i. e.</hi> for Aboliſhing of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and <hi>Common Prayer?</hi> Were they

               <argument>
                  <p>A ſhort View of the other Governments ſet up in oppoſition to Epiſcopacy.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF eminent places or offices, as they give authority and jurisdiction, could like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſecure thoſe that are poſſeſs'd of them from errors in Adminiſtration; if any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or order could ſo Conſecrate the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that bears it, as to exempt him from the Common condition of Humane frailty, and from a poſſibility of being wicked; the world muſt needs be happy, by ſubmitting to ſuch a conſtitution, and then Schiſm and Sedition would have no Pretext. But if after all the Acceſſions of authority and honour, men retain their nature and their manners, and are ſubject to paſſions as they were before, it is no wonder if all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Denominations can furniſh Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous inſtances, of vice and infamy, and the more eminent any order is, the more frequent examples of evil men, it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affords: For the blemiſhes of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are more Conſpicuous, and expos'd to publick view and obſervation, and the eyes
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:64435:222"/>of all men are fix'd upon them, ſo as they will quickly diſcern what is amiſs, nor are they leſs forward to cenſure their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages. Beſides it is poſſible that the Governing part may not always conſiſt of the beſt men, for ambition makes men In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in the purſuit of power, and goes a ſhorter and generally a more effectual, though leſs direct way to obtain it. And when they are in poſſeſſion, they begin to diſcover that temper they before Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concealed, and become more open, ſince they have leſs reſtraint. Laſtly even Power it ſelf is a great temptation, and an eminent private virtue has often times loſt it ſelf in the Exerciſe of Authority, as weak heads grow giddy when they are plac'd upon a height.</p>
               <p>But however it comes to paſs, ſo it is, that there is no ſort of Government whether of Church or State, which any one that has a mind to diſgrace it, may not ſhew to have been in the hands of very infamous Perſons; and that the beſt that have poſſeſs'd it were not without their faults. If one have a mind to Reproach Monarchy there are <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s and <hi>Caligula</hi>'s enough; nay <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Trajan,</hi> who are reckoned the beſt of that rank, had great and ſome inexcuſable faults: If one he inclin'd to raile againſt Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths: the Ingratitude of <hi>Athene</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Carthage</hi> towards their beſt friends and preſervers will furniſh him with Infinite matter. If one would <hi>Diſgrace</hi> Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acy, Church Hiſtory is full of evil contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64435:223"/>Biſhops, <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus, Euſebius, Nicomed, Neſtorius, Dioſcorus,</hi> and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble others: and the moſt Orthodox and holy were not without their blemiſhes. <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Cyril, Epiphanius</hi> had very undecent heats. Nay the Apoſtles themſelves had a <hi>Judas,</hi> and the reſt of them were not free from miſunderſtandings, which muſt needs give great offence to the Church: What ſhall we do then in this caſe? Shall we ſubmit to no Government that has been prophan'd by evil adminiſtration? ſhall we be of no Church that has any mixture of the world? Shall we renounce Monarchy becauſe we have read of Tyrants? or throw down Epiſcopacy, becauſe ſome of that order have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it? By this reaſon we muſt have no Government or order at all, or as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle infers, <hi>we muſt go out of the world.</hi> But ſince our neceſſities require ſome kind of order, and there can no number of men live by any Common Rule, whether of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Law, without authority plac'd in ſome hands or other to enforce it; and ſince God himſelf was pleaſed to appoint the kind of Government under which his Church was to be; notwithſtanding that evil men might creep into the office, we remain ſtill under an Obligation to ſubmit our ſelves to it, and it is not in our power to alter that conſtitution. This Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and all the Diſſenters will eaſily grant, and therefore they ſay that they contend only for the Primitive Inſtitution of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:64435:223"/>Be it ſo: yet this long deduction of reproach and accuſation does not prove any thing to the prejudice of the office; and this notwithſtanding, Epiſcopacy may be the Church Government of the Apoſtles ſetling; for thoſe things that fill Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Indictment againſt Biſhops are the faults of the men not of the Office, and the ſame miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges may be diſcover'd in other kinds of Church Government that are not Epiſcopal. And ſince every project is more plauſible, and ſeems to have fewer inconveniencies in the <hi>Idea</hi> than in the uſe; leſt any one for want of experience, or Hiſtory, may think Presbytery, or any Church Government that is not Epiſcopal to be ſubject to no abuſe or Diſorders, I will give a ſhort account of the Riſe and Progreſs of that form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that has obtain'd in ſuch of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd Churches as have caſt off their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; and ſhew that they have ſuffer'd under the ſame Calamities, that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen Epiſcopal Churches, and are guilty of moſt of the ſame things, as requiring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, Conformity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as our Biſhops againſt whom all this Hiſtory, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is directed.</p>
               <p>It is not yet a Hundred and fifty years that the Church has known any other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but Epiſcopal; and the newer Models of Church Polity have obtain'd but in a ſmall part even of the Reform'd Churches; and that in ſome places under Perſecuting Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who more effectually keep under the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:64435:224"/>Tares in the field of the Church, prevent exceſſes, and Unite the ſuffering Church, than any ſort of Church Government or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline whatſoever: yet the Hiſtories even of theſe Churches can furniſh too many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Tumult and diſorder, of Hereſies Schiſms, and contentions, of Wars, and Deſolations: and if this cannot be drawn into any argument againſt the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an way, there is leſs reaſon it ſhould be urg'd againſt Epiſcopacy, that for ſo long time obtain'd over the Univerſal Church: which under this conſtitution, had <hi>paſs'd through fire and water,</hi> and then was brought <hi>into a wealthy place,</hi> through diſtreſſes, and Perſecutions, through all the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of wealth and power. And in ſhort, through all the Tryals that can be made by all the differences of outward condition, and Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>They who fancy a time when the Church had no Biſhops, do repreſent it as then full of diſcord, and Diſtraction, <hi>(I am of Paul, and I of Apollo, and I of Cephas.)</hi> So that as, they ſay, it was neceſſary for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of peace and Unity to appoint one perſon over the reſt: and if the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian parity had any place in the Primitive times as ſome do imagine, it muſt needs have been an intolerable kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince all on the ſudden it was Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally aboliſh'd; it muſt have given ſtrange occaſion of offence when all the Chriſtian Churches in the world ſhould conſpire to
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:64435:224"/>Abrogate this Polity, and to deſtroy all the memory and footſteps of it, ſo that in the lamentable diſtractions which the Church fell into afterwards under Biſhops, none ſhould ſo much as propoſe this way of relief, by returning to their Ancient Government; and the people that were ſo harraſs'd with perpetual contentions about their Biſhops muſt either think that there could be no Church where there was no Biſhop, or elſe that Presbyterian parity, or a Popular Church Government would occaſion yet greater miſchiefs than thoſe they ſuffer'd. That the inconveniences are not leſs, will appear from the experience of ſuch Churches as have caſt off Epiſcopacy, ſome of which, (at leaſtwiſe a good number of very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding men in them,) do at time this wiſh that they might be govern'd by Biſhops, and conceive it to be the only remedy for their diviſions.</p>

                  </note> Theſe by good providence were neither Biſhops, nor Epiſcopal men, but againſt all ſort of Church Government and order, and while there is any of this leaven remaining, let what ſort of Government you pleaſe obtain, there will never be an end of Schiſm and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For if Epiſcopacy be Aboliſh'd, what ever is eſtabliſh'd in its Room, will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by ſuch men every whit as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian; and Presbyterian Glaſſes and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, or Congregational Epiſcopacy will have no fairer quarter; for theſe will admit no Government, no Law, but that which will permit every one to do what he pleaſes; and that will ſet up a State of Grace juſt like <hi>Hobbs</hi> his ſtate of nature. It is very much to be fear'd, that this is the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing principle among our Anti-Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Diſſenters. And if out of ſuch inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beginnings they increas'd ſo faſt when the fences of our Church had been once taken away, as not only to ruin all projects of unity and Eſtabliſhment, but to poſſeſs themſelves of the Government; what may we expect now when they are
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:64435:225"/>form'd into conſiderable parties, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>number thoſe of the Claſſical and Parochial Presbyterians; that is, all that are for any ſort of ſettlement that may be ſuited to the Circumſtances of this Nation? What may we not have Reaſon to fear, if the Laws which give check to their Inſolences were once taken away? And if they ſhould be taken in under the Notion of Proteſtants? A diſhonour from which it has pleas'd God hitherto to preſerve that name, according to the prayers of the firſt Reformers, who dreaded the growth of Sects, no leſs than the return of Popery it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But beſides that Hereſie may ſpring where there are no Biſhops, as there were none in the Reformation, when thoſe Monſters firſt appear'd; There can be alſo bitter conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about Religion, where Biſhops have nothing to do. <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> were no Biſhops,<note place="margin">M.

Luther</hi> was angry that any body ſhould ſet up himſelf a new maſter in a place where he was ſo much concerned, and could not indure, <hi>Ordinationes ſuas in
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:64435:226"/>Populo preſſâ mea authoritate erigi:</hi> And this contention was ſo Exaſperated that after a Conference, <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> was Baniſhed from <hi>Turingia</hi> by the Elector of <hi>Saxonie</hi>'s order, and the inſtigation of <hi>Luther;</hi> and ſome other Miniſters were turn'd out of their places upon the ſame Account: and the ſufferer did not ſpare to render all this Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as Invidious as he could, and therefore writes a Letter to the people of <hi>Orlamund,</hi> Subſcribed A. <hi>Bodenſtein, non Auditus, non Convictus, à Martino Luthero Ejectus:</hi> If Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or their Councils had been concern'd in this, what Bitter Reflections ſhould we have upon <hi>the Prelatical perſecuting Spirit?</hi> But it ſeems other men as well as Biſhops have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and may diſturb the Church: Yet we are not to aggravate, but to cover as much as we can the frailties of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to retain ſtill a Reverence for the Authority of their Offices, and their Perſonal Excellences.</p>
               <p>But whereever the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Reformation was received, Dioceſan Epiſcopacy ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Church Government; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will be found to have preſerv'd thoſe Churches in as great peace and Unity, if not more, than thoſe had that were Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without Biſhops. The Churches of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> never knew what Schiſm or Hereſie was, but by reading or hear-ſay: and thoſe of <hi>Germany,</hi> though ſomething more diſquieted, yet it was ſeldom from within, but by Projects of Union with
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:64435:226"/>other Churches under a different kind of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as well as of different opinions in ſome points of Religion: It is to be wiſh'd that the Churches of the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confeſſion, as they took care to preſerve the Antient form of Church Governmet, had been alſo a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more careful in the point of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For their Biſhops, though they have the ſame authority with Dioceſans, yet were at firſt ordain'd but by Presbyters; and the Principles of thoſe Churches touching the right of ordination are ſo looſe, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe of the Presbyterian Diſcipline will hardly allow them. <hi>Hunnius</hi> defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Ordinations, ſays, the power is in the Church diffuſive; and that it may be conveyed, not only by Biſhops or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but by Deacons, or any body elſe if the Church think fit: and I am afraid the Practice of ſome of thoſe Churches is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to be juſtifi'd.</p>

               <p>It is time now to Return to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Deſign, which was to ſhew, how no other form of Government can ſecure the Church from Hereſie, Schiſm, and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, any more than Epiſcopacy; and that thoſe Churches which put themſelvs under new Models of Government and diſcipline, have been excercis'd with Schiſm, Hereſie, and Sedition, no leſs than thoſe under Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy.</p>
               <p>The Churches which follow'd the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> had at firſt no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor diſcipline that was properly, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:64435:227"/>All authority reſted in the Civil Magiſtrate, and the Miniſters did only preach and adminiſter the Sacraments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excluding any. It was from this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice (I ſuppoſe) that the Divines of that way came to ſpeak generally ſo looſely of the power of the Keys, making it all to conſiſt in preaching, without any regard to Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline. But the Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs that followed this defect of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government, ſoon open'd the eyes of the Miniſters, who Complain'd paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately of the Increaſe of Libertiniſm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Reformation; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to make the people ſenſible, that there is more required to make a true Proteſtant, than to Renounce the Pope, and Tranſubſtantiation; and that the Notion of a Church did imply ſomething more than a Company of ſound believers met together to hear a Sermon. <hi>Calvin,</hi> a perſon of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Abilities, was one of the firſt that obſerv'd and Complain'd of this defect in the Reformation; and endeavour'd to Remedy it in the Church where he was Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, by Eſtabliſhing an Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:<note place="margin">Baza vit Calv.</note> and that perhaps not ſuch as he thought moſt perfect and abſolute, but ſuch as the Circumſtances of the place would bear. The people of <hi>Geneva</hi> were ſufficiently prejudic'd againſt Epiſcopacy, having turn'd out their Biſhop, who had likewiſe a title to be their Prince; and to have talk'd of Introducing a Biſhop there,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:64435:228"/>would have ſounded as harſh as the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a King would have done to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans after the expulſion of <hi>Tarquin.</hi> But ſuppoſe they could have been Reconcil'd to the name and the office, upon aſſurance it ſhould not exceed its proper bounds; it is poſſible <hi>Calvin</hi> might look upon it as too Invidious a propoſal to his Church, for fear of being underſtood to recommend himſelf; and to affect dominion over his Brethren; Epiſcopacy then ſeeming Impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable in that place, he deviſed a form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that ſhould be more popular and conſequently more acceptable the Miniſters were to be all of equal Authority, and were in the firſt place to govern the Church, and with them a certain number out of the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under the Title of ruling Elders were to have a ſhare in the Church Government; and this mix'd Council without any Biſhop was to exerciſe all Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures and Juriſdiction. One would think this would be unexceptionable, but it proved o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; for this frame was no ſooner begun, but it was preſently broken in pieces, and the Author baniſh'd: But his Reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad made them reflect upon this Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſhame, and deſire him to return: With him this Government was reſtor'd, which was ſo far from remedying all diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that it became the occaſion of ſome very great ones; and the State of that Church as it is diſcrib'd by <hi>Calvin</hi> in his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to his friends, and by <hi>Beza</hi> in his life,

Calv.</note> as to endanger the peace of the City, wanted little of Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Calvins</hi> quarrels with <hi>Perinus</hi> came to that height, that the Council of the City had almoſt cut one anothers throats about it. <hi>Siquidem eouſque ſemel in ipſâ curiâ deven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt, coactis Diacoſiis, &amp; pene exertis jam Enſibus parum abfuerit quin mutuis caedibus ipſam Curiam cruentarent.</hi> And what was the reaſon of ſo dangerous a Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? No Article of the Creed was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; It was not for any part of the faith that they contended ſo fiercely: the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt occaſion of all this ſtir was ſome Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, as Dancing, which the People of <hi>Geneva</hi> were addicted to, and <hi>Calvin</hi> forbad upon pain of Excomunication, this bred the firſt diſcontents. <hi>Perinus</hi> being Captain of the people, and perhaps a lover of Liberty, began to oppoſe this Tyranny, and to charge <hi>Calvin</hi> with falſe Doctrine; two of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters joyn'd with him, and were turn'd out, as Scandalous and Seditious: and ſo by degrees the Contention was improv'd to that deſperate point that the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the City had almoſt deſtroyed one another. I might add a great many more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:64435:229"/>of the Tumults occaſion'd by this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline; and ſhew how diſtracted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Geneva</hi> was during the time of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> meerly upon the account of this form of Eccleſiaſtical Government; But whoever deſires to ſee more may have Recourſe to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s life written by <hi>Beza.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to the Rigours of that Diſcipline, I ſuppoſe the Higheſt Tyranny of Epilcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay can hardly match them. One was put to death at <hi>Geneva</hi> for Libelling <hi>Calvin:</hi> I wiſh the Majeſty of Kings were ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to the men of this way. Another was baniſhed the City for preaching againſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, a hard puniſhment for weakneſs of underſtanding. <hi>Servetus</hi> was burn'd for Hereſie; by the Inſtigation of <hi>Calvin</hi> and the Minſters of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and ſuch others of the Neighbour hood as they could engage in that cauſe; which occaſioned no ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes between them, and ſome other more Moderate Divines: the Caſe of <hi>Ithacius</hi> and the bloody Biſhops, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls them, was not half ſo odious: for this Heretick <hi>Servetus</hi> was burn'd for opinions only, the <hi>Priſcillianiſts</hi> for lewd abominable Practices beſides.</p>
               <p>Nor did <hi>Geneva</hi> only feel the evil effects of this unepiſcopal Government, but it had in a little while an unhappy Influence upon the Neighbouring Churches of <hi>Suitzerland. Eraſtus</hi> having publiſhed his <hi>Theſes</hi> of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, was confuted by <hi>Beza;</hi> yet there remain'd ſtill ſeveral Miniſters diſſatisfi'd;
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:64435:229"/>as <hi>Bullinger, Gualter</hi> and diverſe others. This occaſion'd very great jealouſies between the ſeveral Parties, and it had almoſt come to a Rupture. The Churches of the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate</hi> were no leſs ſhaken with this new Controverſie,<note place="margin">Vid. Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingeri Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Eraſti. Theſ. Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</note> and the zealots for this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and diſcipline took all occaſions publickly to maintain them; but the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that Prince prevented the miſchiefs which threatned his Churches from this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. <hi>Bullinger</hi> in a Letter dated <hi>March.</hi> 10. 1574. and <hi>Gualter</hi> in ſome Letters of his to the Biſhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> and ſeveral other eye-witneſſes do ſufficiently teſtifie the Lamentable condition of thoſe Reformed Churches, and the Confuſion which Presbyterian Government brought upon them.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Geneva</hi> this Government was brought into the Churches of <hi>France.</hi> But what ſucceſs it had there, the Miſerable diſtractions and wars that preſently follow'd do ſufficiently declare: I do not charge all that Tragedy upon this Government; but it ſeems it cannot prevent Tumults, and Sedition, and War, any more than Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy: For with what violence the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was carried on in many parts of that Kingdom, is not unknown to any that has but look'd into the Hiſtories of thoſe times. There were ſome very wiſe men who underſtood the condition of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of opinion, that had the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there proceeded with more Moderation,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:64435:230"/>and been content to have left the Ancient Government, and ſome obſervances of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Antiquity, that Kingdom was in a great diſpoſition to receive it: and in probability all the following Wars, and bloodſhed about Religion would have been prevented.</p>
               <p>That the Reformed Churches of <hi>France</hi> had no conſiderable differences between them, is owing not ſo much to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Government, as to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon danger: which United them cloſer than all the bands of Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides, when they obtained ſome Edicts in favour of their Religion, they Extended them only to ſuch as their Churches would own; and ſo every diſſenter from them, was left to the Rigour of the Laws againſt Hereticks, and enjoy'd no benefit of that Protection which the Reformed Churches were to have. Upon this account the <hi>Lutherans</hi> (of whom there were many in that Kingdom in the beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) were oblig'd either to Conform to the Rule of thoſe Churches, or to leave the Country: and theſe neceſſities kept them along while Undivided. Beſides this, the affairs of that Reformation were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd, not ſo much by their Miniſters, as by the great Perſons who were the Heads of that party: and their Synods were imploy'd not ſo much in making Eccleſiaſtical Canons; as in taking effectual meaſures for their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual defence and preſervation; in receiving
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:64435:230"/>aſſurances of Protection from foreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;<note place="margin">La vie de Mr. Dis Pleſſes. Mornay. p. 119, 120, 123, 124, 231, 280, &amp; 345.</note> in making Alliances; in providing for Peace and War, ſo that they might be more properly call'd Parliaments than Synods, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had their Politick Aſſemblies beſides.</p>
               <p>And yet they were not without their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences about Religion among themſelves. Some Miniſters ſtarting new and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble queſtions in Divinity, their remedy was no other than that of the Ancients, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſuch opinions as they judged to be dangerous by the Authority of their Synods: and they deſcended to take notice of very trifling ſubtilties ſome times, ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unregarded, would perhaps have died of themſelves. The Synod of <hi>Saumur</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Miniſter of <hi>Poictou</hi> for queſtioning the Humanity of Chriſt when he lay in the Grave, and the ſame Aſſembly condemned the Doctrine of a <hi>Suiſs,</hi> not under their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, about juſtification by works after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, a Controverſie meerly about words; another Synod at <hi>Gap.</hi> declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctrine of <hi>Piſcator</hi> about Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which Alarm'd ſome of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches; but the Prudence of <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> prevented any miſchief that might have enſu'd, by ſtopping the proceedings of that Synod. P. D. <hi>Moulin</hi> and <hi>Tilenus</hi> happen'd to have ſome difference of a dangerous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, about the Myſtery of the Incarnation: and notwithſtanding theſe great Profeſſours had learning and diſtinctions enough, (which
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:64435:231"/>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſays the Ancients that firſt mov'd this Controverſie wanted,) yet they could by no means agree about it; and diſputes about <hi>Perſon, Nature, Properties</hi> had like to have endanger'd the peace of thoſe Churches. But how was it prevented? The Litigants were too conſiderable to be paſs'd by with Contempt, and the ſubject of the difference was of ſo high a nature, that it ought not to be left to the hazard of ſo ſlight a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: How then was this Controverſie deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:64435:231"/>into ſuſpition of Hereſie: and his Scholars and followers were brought into no ſmall troubles: What had been allow'd by the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> as ſound Doctrine in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Divines, was now call'd in queſtion in <hi>France,</hi> and what was approv'd in <hi>Camero</hi> while he was alive,<note place="margin">Acts Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentiques per Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</note> became dangerous and Heretical after his death. It is hardly to be imagin'd, what great contention this little, and to ſome, Imperceptible difference did create; or how many Synods it employ'd, <hi>Amyraldus, Dallee, Blondel,</hi> and ſeveral others were look'd upon as little better than He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; and their Doctrine about Original ſin condemn'd in a National Synod at <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton,</hi> and an Abjuration of it requir'd by all thoſe that were to enter into holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and a ſtricct Injunction was layd on all Miniſters upon pain of all the Cenſures of the Church, not to preach any other wiſe of this point than according to the Common opinion.

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:64435:232"/>ſhops can proſecute their private piques to the hazard of the Publick peace; and that there will be contentions where there is no Epiſcopacy.</p>

The Church Government of that Country was not eſtabliſh'd without great trouble and difficulty; and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd no ſmall diſturbance; the Miniſters taking an authority to themſelves of ſetling the Church as they thought fit without the conſent and Concurrence of the Magiſtrates.

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:64435:233"/>of this Synod had never ſeen it, and began to enquire what Confeſſion of 37 Articles it was that they talk'd of. They order'd likewiſe that the form of Excommunication ſhould be, <hi>I deliver thee up to Satan;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more harſh than the Anathema's of Biſhops and their Councils. Here alſo they condemn'd <hi>Kaſpers Colhaes</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> for unſound Doctrine. But he would not ſtand to the judgment of this Synod, that was Judge and Party both, and this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd ſtrange diſorders in the Church of <hi>Leyden,</hi> which continu'd ſtill a kindneſs for their Paſtor notwithſtanding this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Excommunication of the Synod at <hi>Harlem.</hi> However prevail'd they ſo far, that he was turn'd out of his Miniſtry, and forc'd to betake himſelf to a mean employment. This caus'd great diſcontents among the Common people, many of them fell off to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinions, and there was no Communion adminiſtred in that City for a year and a half; and when there was a Communion in the year 82 there were not a hundred perſons preſent at it: If theſe Synods had been Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal what Clamour might we have expected?

               <p>The Synod held at <hi>Harlem</hi> did but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their confuſion. For by the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of <hi>Colhaes</hi> and other proceedings, they brought all things to that confuſion, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> told the States roundly, that unleſs they took ſome care to

And though the ground of the quarrel is ſcarce perceivable, yet it is hardly to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd how great the Animoſities are. This indeed never came to a formal Schiſm, yet it has divided thoſe Churches into formal parties; and in ſome occaſions the quarrel ſeems of more than ordinary conſequence; and has great influence upon the Promotions of the Miniſtry; and the Affections of ſeveral Cites are determin'd to this or that party.</p>
               <p>And as theſe Presbyterian Churches have been afflicted with Schiſm and contentions, ſo they have been ſenſible of the miſchiefs of Hereſie, and labour more than any part of
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:64435:235"/>the Chriſtian world under the Infamy of them. Here the Miniſters have no great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, nor dignities, nor Power; and here are no Patriarchs, nor Biſhops; and yet Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies makes a ſhift to thrive; <hi>Arians, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Menoniſts, Labadyiſts,</hi> and diverſe others; they are neglected, no general Councils diſturb the enjoyment of their errors, and yet they abound, and are pertinacious.</p>
               <p>Nor is it a wonder they take ſuch deep root in Presbyterian Churches; for of late, like Storks, they have affected a republican Church above all others; and it is obſervable that in theſe laſt ages, there have been no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks that have not been likewiſe Anti-Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal; and at the ſame time that they become enemies of the truth, they declare war againſt the Biſhops who are the Guardians of it.</p>
               <p>If it be objected that our Country ſwarms with this Vermin too, it ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from whence they came to be ſo rife among us. It was the taking away of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy that opened ſuch a door to errors; and there were more Hereſies ſtarted here in the ſpace of four years after Biſhops had been laid aſide, if <hi>Edwards</hi> reckons right, than have been known in the Univerſal Church from the foundation of it to that time. And thoſe that fall into Herefie here, do it commonly by degrees; They begin with Schiſm, and end in Enthuſiaſm and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; firſt they are Presbyterians, and then, if that diſpenſation be not ſpiritual enough, they are improv'd in to Independents, and
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:64435:236"/>from thence to the fifth Monarchy or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm. All the extravagant Hereſies among us are but the ſpawns of the firſt Schiſm, and the conſequences of thoſe Principles of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that draw them from the Communion of the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> has felt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions occaſion'd by this Parity of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters more than any of her Neighbours; and though it has not been divided by a formal Schiſin 'till of late, yet from the firſt ſetting up of this Government, it has been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd with perpetual contentions, and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and Sedition, about Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.

                  <hi>The Church of</hi> Scotland <hi>is an Eminent inſtance, that Churches which have no Biſhops have incomparably leſs Hereſie, Schiſm, wickedneſs, and more concord than we have here.</hi> For the concord of that Church, it was much greater while it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd under Superintendents and Biſhops, than it has been ſince <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iturli'd it with the Perfection of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Diſcipline and Government. For a long time after, all the Diſputes about Religion were reduc'd into one point of Eccleſiaſtical ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign juriſdiction; which they diſputed againſt the King and the Government, with ſuch perpetual Seditions, and Treaſons, as at laſt engag'd three Kingdoms in moſt unnatural and bloody Wars; which ended in the ſlavery of them all, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of thoſe that were the firſt Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, through the wiſe and juſt judgment
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:64435:236"/>of God. What Schiſm there aroſe in the late times, between the diſciplinarians, and the reſt; and what diſturbances the ſame ſort of men have given of late; is too well known to need a relation, and the field Conventieles ſtill witneſs. But becauſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would perſwade us that there is ſuch great concord to be found in Anti-Epiſcopal Churches, and particularly in this; I will give one Inſtance, that ſhall let the reader ſee how far this way is from eſtabliſhing a laſting Concord; and withal how this pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is pretended, is really no more than a pretence, the leading men againſt Biſhops commonly aſſuming greater authority, and exerciſing it with greater Abſoluteneſs, and more Impatient of being oppos'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted, than any Biſhops who are legally Inveſted with power.</p>

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:64435:237"/>into factions; ſome holding with one, and ſome with the other, which occaſioned great ſcandal: and the heats grew to that height, that the Presbytery was forc'd to be divided; one part of it to ſit at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the other at <hi>Couper;</hi> the one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Influence of <hi>Melvil,</hi> and the other under that of <hi>Th.

                  <hi>and that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which in the beginning did break forth into ſuch Schiſms, could not long continue; for this every man noted, That of all men none could worſe endure Parity, and lov'd more to Command than they who had introduc'd it into the Church.</hi> This ſort of men did afterwards make not only a formal Schiſm, and inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection againſt thoſe Biſhops plac'd over them by authority, but after that Epiſcopacy was aboliſh'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> could be as little at peace among themſelves. They were in the firſt place divided about the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King, and the Conditions to be Impos'd upon him; and in this they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded even to the Excommunication of one another. After his Majeſties Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when Epiſcopacy was again eſtabliſh'd in the Church: the Presbyterians who ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Communion of the Biſhops, were divided yet among themſelves ſome
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:64435:237"/>accepting the Kings Indulgence and Licence to Preach, others renouncing it as deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this they parted Communion; Nor could theſe reſolute Renouncers of Indulgence agree yet among themſelves, about the meaſure of their Contempt of authority; ſome were content to Conventicle, and Preach againſt the Kings order, and carry their Contempt no farther; the others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Cameron</hi> were more fiercely Zealous, and thought themſelves oblig'd by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to attempt the depoſing of the King, as they manifeſted (beſides their ſeveral Writings to that effect,) by two formal Rebellions: Theſe are the fruits, this the Peace and Unity that Presbytery, and the Scotch Covenant produc'd, the Covenant ſo much Idolz'd once by our Presbyterians of <hi>England,</hi> and which notwithſtanding all the Miſchiefs that attended it here, and do ſtill iſſue from it in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they are yet loth to renounce, though required ſo to do by all the Authority in the Nation.</p>
               <p>But what is all this to Congregational E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy? It is not Presbytery, but this that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Contends for: He is for Biſhops, and would only pare off the ſuperfluities of their Dioceſes, and reduce them to their firſt bounds. To which I anſwer: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s. Congregational Biſhop and Pariſh Presbyter is all one; and he has taken ſo much pains to prove it in his Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy, that it were an injury to his
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:64435:238"/>ſincerity to queſtion his opinion of it. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there was ſome neceſſity to ſay all this of Presbyterian Governments being ſubject to Hereſies and Schiſms as well as Epiſcopal; becauſe Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himſelf had made the compariſon between them; and charg'd all Schiſms and Hereſies upon Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan Epiſcopacy, as the fault of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; it was therefore neceſſary to ſee how all ſorts of Governments of the Church, as well as of the State, may be diſturb'd by evil and factious men, and are ſubject to great inconveniences when they fall into evil hands. But then what Schiſms can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to this Congregational way? This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be anſwered without asking a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: was this Congregational Epiſcopacy ever eſtabliſh'd in any Churches? If not, it will be as hard a matter to ſhew what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, it has occaſion'd as it is to diſcover what Civil Wars happen'd in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, or to reckon the Differences of Sects of Philoſophers in the College of <hi>Atlantis.</hi> If this Government has been ſet up any where, it is but naming the time and place, and it may be that ſome account may be given of the Schiſms and Hereſies that moleſted it. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> contends it was the firſt, Apoſtolical, and Scripture conſtitution: and ſhews at large that a Church was but one Congregation, and a Biſhop could have but one Church. Well: but there were Schiſms and Hereſies then: and St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent complaints of them. Or if this ſort
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:64435:238"/>of Government continu'd for ſome Centuries after, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would make it appear; it muſt be likewiſe granted that there never were greater and more Blaſphemous Hereſies than in thoſe times, and for Schiſms, they could not be avoided, it ſeems, and though a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe were but one Congregation; the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters could not agree who ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern that, but divided it into ſeparate Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. But to this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Anſwers,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That the Multitude of Sects and Hereſies that ſprung up in the firſt and ſecond and third ages of the Church was no diſhonour to the form of Government then us'd in the Church, as ſhould encourage any man to diſlike or change it.</hi> Why then does he endeavour to diſhonour Dioceſan Epiſcopacy upon this very reaſon? and why does he reproach it with the Schiſms and Hereſies that happen'd under that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? But no man can reaſon againſt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> better than himſelf does in the very ſame Paragraph; it is but taking away the word <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and putting in the ſtead of it <hi>Congregational Epiſcopacy,</hi> and then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more full to our purpoſe. <hi>If it was Congregational Epiſcopacy that was us'd, then Swarms of Sects and Hereſies may come in notwithſtanding Congregational Epiſcopacy (even in better hands than yours). But if it was not Congregational Epiſcopacy that was then the Government</hi> (but Dioceſan Epiſcopacy) <hi>Hereſies are no more a ſhame to that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now:</hi> I wiſh Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had conſider'd this place when he conceiv'd the firſt deſign of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:64435:239"/>his <hi>Church Hiſtory:</hi> perhaps he might have ſeen the Inconſequence of his deſign <hi>to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour Biſhops and their Councils,</hi> from a long deduction of Schiſms and Hereſies which he lays at their door, and have forborn giving this juſt offence to all that have any real concern for the Honour of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is no leſs concern'd in all theſe diſgraces than Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>Yet I ſhall willingly diſcharge Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Epiſcopacy from any Imputation of thoſe evils that diſturb'd the Church in the firſt times, and be content Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſhould lay it all to the account of Dioceſan Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which I ſhall ſhew at large in the next Chapter to have been the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Primitive Churches; in the mean time, I muſt enquire a little farther after the Glorious fruit of this Congregational Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>If the Ancient Church was quite a ſtranger to this kind of Epiſcopacy, it will be a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er matter to find it in latter ages, ſince Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells us that Biſhopricks were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged ſo enormouſly in proceſs of time, that ſeveral Cathedrals were turn'd into Chapels, and inſtead of, one Congregation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Biſhop had ſeveral Scores and Hundreds: And the Reformation where it retain'd Biſhops, made them all Dioceſans, and ſet them over ſeveral Congregational Churches; thus the <hi>Bohemians, Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>Germany:</hi> beſides theſe three Kingdoms. Where they Aboliſh'd Epiſcopal,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:64435:239"/>Government, they threw away the Titles too, ſo that if Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s kind of Epiſcopacy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd any where, it muſt be under another name, therefore that we may diſcover it, it will be neceſſary to give a ſhort deſoription of it, and then we may poſſibly find it to have acted under the diſguiſe of another name.</p>
               <p>This Congregational Biſhop then,<note place="margin">Treatiſe of Ep.</note> which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes ſo much a do about, is the ſame thing with an Elder, as he tells us, and takes great pains to prove it. 2.

               <p>Laſtly, This Project of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (in which there is one thing not ſo agreeable to the practice of Antiquity, which is the Major part of the Presbyters concluding the Biſhop, who alwayes had a Negative voice, and nothing ever becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Act, without his conſent and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation)
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:64435:249"/>this I ſay may perhaps be of ſome uſe to make an accommodation, between <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Government, by <hi>Claſſes</hi> and <hi>Synods,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Epiſcopacy: but it wholly overthrows Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Congregational way, however qualifi'd by the Independent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Conſociation, beyond which Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s Notion of Church Government, and conſtitution does not extend.</p>
               <p>Therefore, to leave this Epiſcopacy of Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhers</hi> as deſtructive of <hi>Independence,</hi> why may not they of the Congregational way prevent ſuch inconveniences as they have fallen into, by ſome quallifying Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in favour of <hi>Conſociation,</hi> and ſome abatement in their Punctiliouſneſs of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting into full Communion, and <hi>Church-memberſhip?</hi> And thus far no doubt Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does comply: to which I anſwer, That the Fundamental Principle of this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way does diſpoſe it to all manner of confuſion, which I undertook to ſhew in the laſt place.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay nothing to ſuch Principles of our Independents as have no neceſſary Connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with the nature of their Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as thoſe of ſeparation from every defect in ordinances and the like, they are beſides my purpoſe, and the miſchief, and unreaſonableneſs of them have been ſhew'd already with ſo much light, and advantage by the Incomparable Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> as to be able to convince any men who did miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in good earneſt; as to that part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:64435:249"/>I will ſuppoſe them ſatisfi'd in point of Conſcience though not perhaps in point of Honour, and conſider only the miſchiefs of their Government, abſtracted from their other opinions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Independent</hi> or Congregational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is founded upon theſe two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſt and his Apoſtles inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Congregational Churches, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued them with all the Power that is given the Church: as of cenſures, Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the like, without any dependence one on another, or of ſeveral upon one Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Paſtor, and that the ſingle Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations planted at firſt in ſeveral Cities when they came to encreaſe beyond the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Perſonal Communion, were to Imitate Bee-hives, and to ſend out Colonies under their proper Officers, without any dependence on the mother Hive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That what was thus inſtituted by Chriſt and his Apoſtles muſt ſo continue, it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the power of man, or the Church to alter it.</p>
               <p>This is the foundation of Independent Government, and if you abate any thing of theſe Principles, the whole Fabrick muſt fall to pieces.</p>
               <p>If you deny the firſt that Chriſt or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did not inſtitute ſuch Churches, the Congregational way has no pretence, or if you will ſay that the firſt that were planted were indeed of this kind, but accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:64435:250"/>there being no more believers in any City than might meet in one Congregation it equally deſtroys it: for when Chriſtians were multipli'd into ſeveral Congregations they might put themſelves under another form more commodious for preſerving Unity among them.</p>
               <p>If you deny the ſecond, that though the Apoſtolical Churches were of this Model, yet that it was not neceſſary, and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it will remove all juſt reaſon of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about it; for the Church having made uſe of its liberty in the change of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which it is ſuppos'd to have power to do as it ſaw occaſion, nothing can be more unreaſonable, than to tear it in pieces upon this occaſion, unleſs it has done ſomething that it had no authority to do, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Government Eſtabliſh'd by Chriſt with out his leave: in ſhort if the Apoſtles did not found Congregational Churches, there is no reaſon why we ſhould ſet them up; if they did found them at firſt, but did deſign they ſhould continue no longer, than till the numbers of Chriſtians ſhould exceed one Congregation, the ſucceſs of the Goſpel has chang'd that form: If they were founded at firſt, and then the matter left to the diſcretion of the Church to frame it ſelf according to its beſt convenience, the Church has already determin'd it, there can be no Controverſie: So that if any of theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be deni'd, the Congregational Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt fall of courſe.</p>
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:64435:250"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Independency,</hi> therefore being founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a firm belief of thoſe Fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which cannot be left, but the whole frame muſt ſink, I ſhall proceed to ſhew the unavoidable miſchiefs that belief expoſes theſe Congregational Churches to.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the miſchiefs that this way occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by rendring any Union between par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches Impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The miſchiefs it produces in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches or Congregations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the Impoſſiblity of preſerving any Unity between Independent Churches.</p>
               <p>Theſe Churches like ſo many little So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignties crowded together within the ſame Territory, and a great number of them within the Walls of the ſame City, their Vicinity and Cohabitation gives them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and begets a neceſſity of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence and Communication between them; and this begetting a mutual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of each others opinions and practice, differences will ariſe, and endanger their peace; and what remedy is there, ſince there is no common Court to put an end to it? It muſt be a lamentable caſe when every quarrel, becomes a War; and there is no end but either Ruin, or at laſt, when they are tyr'd with contention, their Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Acquieſcence. But you will ſay there is the ſame Inconvenience in Epiſcopacy; for if Biſhops fall out about Religion who ſhall judge between them? if you ſay Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans and Synods; ſuppoſe two Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:64435:251"/>then ſhould differ, or two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils: It were much better they would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but if they will quarrel, it is not quite ſo bad as if thoſe that live in the ſame City, and under the ſame Government ſhould fall out; ſuppoſe our Church could not adjuſt all Articles of Faith and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline with the Churches of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,</hi> good men would wiſh that it might be made up, and that there were a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Harmony in our Confeſſions: But in caſe this could not be effected, yet the Controverſie would remain pretty quiet within the books that ſhould be written about it: But if within the City of <hi>London</hi> thoſe Controverſies ſhould be unhappily ſtarted, and one Pariſh take one ſide of the Queſtion, and another the contrary, it would be ſomething more dangerous; and an Intolerable defect in the conſtitution of our Church to have no effectual reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to apply to the beginnings of this Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But what hurt is it, you may ſay, let both enjoy their own opinion, if they would do ſo with Peace it were ſomething; but theſe little republick Churches, like <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> his <hi>Vortexes</hi> grate and make Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion one upon the other; Some members of one Congregation may be ſeduc'd by the other, and the whole perhaps in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being carried away with evil Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or example, what ſhall be done in this caſe? They can ſubmit to no Judge; for they are immediately under Chriſt; they
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:64435:251"/>muſt have no <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> no <hi>Claſſes,</hi> no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Controul them; what then? They muſt wrangle to the worlds end; or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and come to nothing as many of their Congregations have done.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Independents</hi> have been made very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this by a ſad experience of great and Irremediable diſſenſions, and ſome of them have been ſo ingenuous as to confeſs it, and enter'd into ſome meaſures for an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Prevention of theſe diſorders: by way of Conſociation or Synods: but neither can relieve them as long as they maintain the principles before mentioned, <hi>i. e.</hi> as long as they are <hi>Independents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. What <hi>Conſociation</hi> can there be between thoſe bodies of men, that cannot be United under any Common Government, to which the particulars are to be ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate? Without any Laws to correct them, without authority to execute them, without any ſubordination of the Members: what Permanent <hi>Conſociation</hi> can be expected, that muſt depend upon the pleaſure of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Congregation of that Aſſociation? that remains ſtill Independent, and under no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to ſubmit any farther than it ſelf thinks good? This is the caſe of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, either there muſt be General Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to take care of this <hi>Conſociation,</hi> as <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Superviſors,</hi> or ſome Committees any Synods, and theſe muſt have ſome pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the particular Congregations under their Inſpection, or there muſt be no ſuch
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:64435:252"/>Officers: If that be allow'd, it is no more <hi>Independence,</hi> but <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Epiſcopacy or Presbytery: And overthrows the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principle, that the Congregations immediately under Chriſt, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution cannot be alter'd for any conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. If they have no Perſons appointed over the Generality, then wherein does this Conſociation conſiſt, or how are they Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? But ſuppoſe they have Synods, as they had one in the <hi>Savoy</hi> 1658. What can they be able to do? They may adviſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the matter, but if any particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation be obſtinate, they cannot cenſure, that Importing a Superiority, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the notion of Congregational <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> to make this clearer, if poſſible, ſuppoſe ſomething like <hi>Hobbs</hi> his State of nature, That Twenty men, who can have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of authority one over the other, were caſt upon an Iſland; and their Common neceſſities would oblige them to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and maintain ſome Commerce and agreement, and that every one ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve firmly that God had not only made him free, but that he had laid an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on him ſo to continue, and never to ſubject himſelf to any Creature, upon the pretence of any conveniences of life. How ſhould theſe men do? They might conſult, and agree upon a rule, they might make a diſtribution of proprieties, and promiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to hurt or injure one the other: But theſe men being ſubject to the ſame Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:64435:252"/>and diſorders with others, it is not to be expected they ſhould live long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome bodies tranſgreſſing his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And then what ſhall be done to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this <hi>Conſociation</hi> of Kings? Every one is ſacred and cannot be called before any Tribunal, but his own Conſcience; and that perhaps he may diſpenſe with: he muſt not ſubmit to any one, nor to all his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates together, nor can they, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that opinion of Original Freedom, uſurp any Authorities over him; What can ſuch a Conſtitution produce? Either their indignation, or neceſſity muſt prevail over their principles, and ſo they muſt ſubmit to Government, or elſe if they retain theſe fancies of Independant Soveraignity and freedom, they muſt diſſolve and break all to pieces, and renounce all communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one with the other.</p>
               <p>You will ſay that good men will agree, and preſerve ſuch an union as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſities require, without any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior power to inforce it: But the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> know by woful experience, that all have not proved Saints that they have received for ſuch, though they were as punctilious in the admitting of them as the Pope in a <hi>Canonization;</hi> beſides this, reaſon will deſtroy the diſcipline of Congregational as well as of aſſociated Churches: for every good man will do his duty, and what need therefore of any power in the congregation to cenſure.</p>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:64435:253"/>
               <p>It is plain therefore that Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Churches, unleſs they renounce the Principles of their Independence, cannot enter into any ſolid and laſting union, having no means to preſerve it, and all the union that their Principles will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit can be no other than that of a heap of ſand, where the parts are looſe and unconnected, and therefore una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably ſcattered and diſſipated by the firſt Wind that ſhall ariſe.</p>
               <p>Nor is this Congregational Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leſs pernicious to the Peace of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, than it is to a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral union of many Congregations, which I ſhall make appear by the following rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Firſt in General; and then by exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the different forms there may be of Admininiſtring this Congregational power.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that lyeth under an unjuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Congregation has no relief; for this being Independent, there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by how much the deprivation of Communion, is a ſorer puniſhment to thoſe who have known the value of the Ordinances of Chriſt, and have taſted the grace of God in them, than any other that can be inflicted on mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or eſtates. And here can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relief but by Separation and Schiſm.</p>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:64435:253"/>
               <p n="2">2. When a Paſtor is turned Heretick, and has ſeduc'd his Congregation into a good opinion of his Doctrine, they have no relief, becauſe they have no judge to examine the Doctrine, and to remove the evil from among them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a Congregation ſhall conſpire to be wicked, turn <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who ſhall cenſure them for it? the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate may not be a Chriſtian, or may not take notice of it.</p>
               <p>But the inconveniences of this way may be farther obſerv'd, by looking into the ſeveral forms, whereby this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Supremacy either is or may be Adminiſtred.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Suppoſe the Paſtor inveſted with this whole power, without any appeal to be made from his ſentence; what tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would this independence be to abuſe that unaccountable power, ſince no ſuperior Court could reviſe his Acts? And if this man ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uld prove impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and wilful in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo great a power, what peace could be expected? And yet we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this power ſhould fall often into the evil hands, and it muſt be a wretched conſtitution that ſhould not make ſome proviſion againſt it. But in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational way, the firſt thing is extremity: But I will not urge this, becauſe the Independents will not allow the Paſtor any ſuch power, and therefore let us conſider
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:64435:254"/>this way as managed by the Paſtor, and a ſelect Presbytery: the inconveniences are rather greater. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In many Congregations the Church power muſt come into the hands of ſuch as have little capacity, or experience, and by that means would become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe they ſhould not all agree upon a Sentence of Excommunication, muſt the majority conclude it? and againſt the opinion of the Miniſter? This would be ſomething hard for him to pronounced ſentence againſt his own judgment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn a perſon he believes to be innocent; if he does refuſe, then he reſiſts the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, and that muſt needs produce a Rupture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They of the ſelect Presbytery muſt be ſuppoſed, to have a mixture with the reſt by way of dealing, and commerce, and this begetting differences and feuds between them, it cannot be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>voided but that Church cenſures will be abuſed to revenge private Animoſities: and thoſe upon whom they are to be executed, will be more loth to ſubmit when they recollect that they proceed from perſons they had diſoblig'd: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reflecting upon their guilt, they will be apt to aſcribe all to private grudge: upon which reaſon in common Law, he that is ſuppoſed to be judged by his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, has the liberty to reject any with whom he has had any falling out.</p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:64435:254"/>
               <p n="4">4. This would probably degenerate into a civil Tyranny, when a poor man ſhould refuſe to comply with ſome of his Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Judges, to his own diſadvantage, they would find ſome advantage againſt him: and by diſgracing him in the Congregation, ruine him conſequently in his lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The exerciſing of ſuch cenſures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo little compaſs as that of a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the members of it one on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt in a little while ingage the whole body in parties and factions, without any hopes of uniting, the ſufferers will be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and when they grow numerous will not conceal their reſentments, but bend them to the diſturbance of that Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal unity.</p>
               <p>But laſtly if we ſuppoſe the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation concerned to declare it ſelf in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of Excommunication; few of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences before mentioned will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and there will be others yet greater. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It cannot well be avoided but upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſes the Congregation will be divided, and when it happens to be upon the ſubject of removing from, or reſtoring to Church communion, ſuch differences do lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Schiſm; for ſince there is no judge between them, every party will likely ſtand by its own opinion, and will hardly ſubmit their judgments to the majority of the other ſide, that out-votes them but by a few voices:
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:64435:255"/>Thoſe that were fierce for turning a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber out of Church fellowſhip, becauſe they are offended with him, will likelier quit the Congregation and ſet up for themſelves, than endure the Communion of that which they cryed out upon as ſo great a ſcandal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The wiſeſt and beſt men who are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the feweſt will be of no uſe, for they will be overborn with number.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will make a conſtant trade of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and making of parties.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore, If the Church hath been afflicted with Schiſms and Hereſies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Dioceſan Biſhops, we have ſeen that it has ſuffered the ſame things under other ſorts of Government, but that which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> offers as a remedy of diſorders, has been the leaſt able to preſerve the Church from diviſions, nor were thoſe infinite breaches accidental only, as the beſt Government in the world cannot prevent all inconveniences, but were the natural fruit of that conſtitution, which would not be able to preſerve peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Churches of one City, how much leſs between the numerous Congregations of a Kingdom: and is ſuch a form as deſtroyes it ſelf, and pulls even particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in pieces, by unavoidable feuds and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons firſt, and then by formal Schiſm and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in a Book publiſhed ſince his <hi>Church Hiſtory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Treatiſe of Epiſc. Part <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> gives us ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Original of Biſhops and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſans, as would make one ſuſpect he had had ſome late Revelation; for he ſpeaks ſo particularly of ſuch things, which no body elſe ever heard of, and ſhews all the firſt cauſes of the riſe of Epiſcopacy after ſo new a manner, that it muſt be either new Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or ſome new Authors found out: But becauſe nothing of theſe appears in the Margin, I am apt to believe it was rather a Dream: For he tells us, <q>That in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there were but few Scholars and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers converted, who were able to Preach, and theſe men of parts <hi>Overtop'd the reſt,</hi> and where ſuch as theſe were found, <hi>they were highlier eſteemed than the reſt,</hi> and theſe in ſome time became Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, being made firſt Arbitratours, and then as more learned Judges of true and falſe Doctrine, nay, being wiſer than all the reſt, it was fit he ſhould have a negative voice; and Fourthly, they underſtood their own value well enough, and that made them proud and deſire preheminence.
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:64435:256"/>And, Laſtly, one Biſhop was ſet over ſome Churches for want of more able men, and he having got the ſtart of the others that came after, made them truckle to him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi> had a quite contrary dream, and for my part I do not know a better way of Anſwering one Dream but with another, he Dream'd I ſay, (for he had ſurely never ſeen it with his eyes open) <q>That theſe gifts were not had in any ſo great eſteem then,<note place="margin">Apologia pro ſentent.

All that I can affirm is, that the Ancients talk of Biſhops in every age, up to the Apoſtles times, and make theſe Biſhops their ſucceſſours; but of the occaſions of their promotion there is not a word, only St. <hi>Jerom</hi> a great while after their inſtitution aſcrib'd it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which parity produc'd: But as to the time Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Treat. of Ep.

               <p>To this the Aſſertors of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way make ſeveral exceptions,<note place="margin">Grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Presb. and Independ. in the Anſwer to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Diſſ.

               <p>They Except, 1. That the firſt three thouſand Converts were not all of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but returned home after the Feaſt was over, but of this no other proof than that there were <hi>dwelling</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> devour men of ſeveral Nations, or as they render it <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing:</hi> and it is not very ſignificant how we underſtand it, ſince the Scripture ſayes expreſly, that they <hi>continued in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip.</hi> But of this already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the five thouſand is not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the other three, but includes them:
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:64435:260"/>There needs no other Anſwer to this, than to refer them to the place, which is clear enough of it ſelf: The miracle wrought on the Cripple that ſate in the Gate of the Temple, and the Sermon that ſeconded it was altogether occaſional, and there can be no reaſon to imagine the whole Church then to be met together in that place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in thoſe Countries there were much greater Congregations than can be with us, as ſome of thoſe that followed our Saviour, who Preached to <hi>Myriads,</hi> and the reaſon is offered, becauſe the air is more pure and thin. That at <hi>Charenton,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation conſiſts of many thouſands: This is manifeſtly to trifle, and to Libel their own cauſe, by reaſons that are impertinent, or ridiculous.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Adds, they had better Lungs; in thoſe times and places, he might have ſaid as well, that they had better Ears, and a quicker hearing, or that they could underſtand a mans meaning by his gaping.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They ſay that this being the firſt Church, and under the joyn'd care of all the Apoſtles, might ſoon arrive to the greateſt meaſure of a Church: What is this in effect but to yield the queſtion? How they came to that number we ſee well enough, but the thing contended is, that their number did exceed a Congregation; beſides they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed ſo well to have multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo very ſoon, if the Miniſtry of
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:64435:260"/>theſe Apoſtles had not been divided, and ſome Preached in one Aſſembly, and others in another.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They ſay there was liberty till <hi>Sauls</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. And what then? Under that liberty the Church might exceed the meaſure of a ſingle Congregation in leſs time.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſayes, this is no precedent: And why? The Mother Church gathered, and governed by all the Apoſtles together, (which is a circumſtance that perhaps no other Church can boaſt of) Why ſhou'd not this be a precedent? The truth is it ſpoils a notion of Congregational Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Churches, and becauſe it cannot be made to comply, it muſt be proteſted againſt that it be not brought into a Precedent.</p>

                  </gap>: againſt theſe proofs there lies one great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: The number of Converts on one ſide are ſpecified, and it plainly thence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that there was no poſſibility they ſhould all meet together, for all acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: but on the other ſide, all the proof is in general expreſſions, the <hi>whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and the <hi>all</hi> may denote only thoſe that were preſent, and not all that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it is ſaid <hi>Luke</hi> 1.10. <hi>The whole
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:64435:261"/>multitude of the people were without Praying, i.e.</hi> not all the people of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but the whole multitude that was preſent; ſo the meeting <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> may be ſaid of ſeveral Congregations meeting for the ſame purpoſe as well as of one.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Independents</hi> in the Aſſembly of Divines did ſeem to give up this point, and to grant that before the diſperſion there might be more than one Congregation of Chriſtians; but that after they were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, there remained no more than could meet in one place: Suppoſe all this: what advantage can it be to their cauſe: if there were more once than might meet in one Aſſembly, and ſo were forc'd to divide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral; and this notwithſtanding to retain the name but of one Church, becauſe under one common Government, it follows that whereſoever the Chriſtians ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards increaſe in the ſame manner, they might likewiſe be governed after the ſame manner, and in ſeveral Congregations, ſtill preſerve the Unity of the Church: If there were no more afterwards than one Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, it is plain, that it was only caſual; if I may ſo ſpeak of the circumſtances of the Church.</p>
               <p>Nor is that true in fact which they affirm of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after the diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for though they are <hi>all</hi> ſaid to be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered beſides the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Acts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now from this account of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it appears manifeſtly, 1. That it was <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> from the beginning, and ſome of the Authors that atteſt it, liv'd in that time, when the Apoſtolical Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is pretended to be chang'd into Epiſcopacy, by <hi>Blondel,</hi> and it ſhews no leſs the vanity of Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s conceit about the Original of Biſhops.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Biſhops of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were Dioceſan's having the overſight of ſeveral Congregations, which is neceſſarily inferr'd from the expreſs numbers of Converts, from general expreſſions of wonderful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions; from the jealouſy of the Scribes and Phariſees, who apprehended from the progreſs Chriſtianity made, that all <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> would ſoon become Chriſtians; from the farther accounts of its increaſe, and of
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:64435:264"/>the innumerable multitudes that were added to it, and this is ſufficient to ſhew the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mr. <hi>B.</hi>'s conjecture, who makes <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> to be the firſt patterns of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, and that not till after the beginning of the third Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Nor was the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſingular in its conſtitution, but all other Churches of the Apoſtles planting were of the ſame kind, and deſign'd for the like, and yet farther increaſe: The beginnings of them as of all other things were but ſmall, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Seed,</hi> which is yet capable of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious improvement, and the ſlip when firſt planted is but ſingle, yet afterwards it ſhoots out ſeveral branches, which though never ſo mnumerous, and at ſome diſtance one from the other, yet communicate all in the ſame ſame body and root: The deſign of the Goſpel is not like thoſe of the Authors of Sects, or Religious orders to have only a ſelect company of followers, that are much at leiſure, but great and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, and ſuited to the whole World: There is no Sex, no Capacity, no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but is deſign'd to be brought into the Church, and to be digeſted the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly that may be, ſo that there <hi>may be one fold under one Shepherd,</hi> Chriſt the Univerſal Paſtor: The Schools of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and the Synagogues of the Jews were to narrow foundations for ſuch a
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:64435:265"/>building as that of the Chriſtian Church; which are to be larger in proportion to the greatneſs of the Fabrick: and it is no leſs the ſtrength than beauty of the whole to have its Stones and Timber, the parts of which it conſiſts, of ſomething a greater magnitude than thoſe of private and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary building: nor can it yet ſtand without there be ſome kind of coherence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, at leaſt wiſe where the people that are members of the Church, are likewiſe united in a political communion, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection ought particularly to be regarded, which the Apoſtles in their firſt planting of the Goſpel had an eye to, as ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved farther in the courſe of Dioceſan E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, which after this digreſſion I am going to purſue.</p>
               <p>The firſt Perſecution that was raiſed againſt the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was by the good Providence of God turned into the happy occaſion of planting ſeveral other Churches, and that ſtorm which was deſigned to quench that fire that came down from Heaven, ſcattered the ſparks of it into all the Regions round about: <hi>Samaria</hi> was the firſt place we read of that entertained the Goſpel when it had been forced out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>

               <p>Thus far the Scripture diſcovers the riſe and progreſs of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, which was the form of Church Government under the Apoſtles, who had large Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſuperviſe, and their ſuffragans, ſuch as are commonly called Evangeliſts, had ſeveral Congregations to govern, and this was undeniably the conſtitution of the Church in the firſt age; the next thing we are to inquire is, whether the Office ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired with thoſe Perſons, or was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be of perpetual uſe in the Church.</p>
               <p>The Adverſaries of Epiſcopacy are not all agreed as to this point, the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans generally looking upon the offices of Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, extraordinary as the perſons were: Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is ſomething more ſcrupulous, becauſe he does not find any where, that Chriſt deſign'd to have this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, and yet he condemns Dioceſan E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy as being altogether different from it. I have ſaid ſomething to this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:64435:275"/>and therefore I ſhall anſwer here more briefly:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we have no reaſon to believe from Scripture that the Office of Apoſtles or Evangeliſts which concerned the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church was extraordinary, and for a time only; and the extraordinarineſs of their gifts can be no argument againſt their continuance, for notwithſtanding they did many miraculous things, yet they never could contrive to be in two places a the ſame time, and as to their governing of ſeveral Congregations, they were under the ſame inconveniences with their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors: They viſited from place to place, they called the Presbyters of ſome Churches to them to give them directions, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by information, and legal evidence, and what was poſſible to them to do in theſe caſes, is not become impoſſible to thoſe that ſucceed them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All other offices had extraordinary men in thoſe dayes, and the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will hold againſt Presbyters and Deacons as againſt Biſhops, for the firſt Deacons that were elected were men <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The unfixedneſs of theſe is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the reaſon of their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and all that will follow from that is no more than this, that if it was eſſential to their office to be unfixed they ought to be ſo ſtill, and not to ceaſe to be at all.</p>
               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:64435:275"/>
               <p n="4">4. All of them were not unfixed, and if they had been ſo, it does not follow that the nature of their office requires it, it might be no more than accidental.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That they governed ſeveral Churches, and were Arch-Biſhops; As to the notion of Church or Churches, it is not very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial whether we ſay, Biſhop of one or of many Churches; for many worſhipping Churches may make but one Governing Church, and worſhipping Churches may have their officers too, as our Pariſhes, but ſtill in ſubordination to the Biſhop, as the ſeveral Churches under theſe Evangeliſts and Apoſtles were ſubordinated to them, in matter of Diſcipline, and Ordination.</p>
               <p>But becauſe many depend upon the title, which theſe ſecondary Apoſtles have in Scripture, as <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded <hi>to do the werk of an Evangeliſt,</hi> it is neceſſary to obſerve that it was not all their work, to Preach and Propagate the Goſpel, but to ſettle Churches, to govern them, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Officers, to cenſure offenders, theſe are the things particularly given in Charge, that of Evangeliſts was common to them with divers others. But ordination is made their peculiar right: For why did <hi>Paul</hi> leave <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> one in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the other in <hi>Crete</hi> to ordain Elders? Were there not Presbyters in <hi>Epheſus</hi> already? Might not they ordain? Might not they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Accuſations,</hi> and Excommunicate? Why then was there one ſingle Perſon left
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:64435:276"/>to do all this? and in <hi>Crete,</hi> it is not to be conceived, but that ſince St. <hi>Paul</hi> had converted ſeveral to the faith in that Iſland, he alſo had ordained ſome Church Officers in thoſe places of the Iſland where he moſt reſided: Or what need had he to leave a Biſhop behind him to ordain, when he might by the ordination of a few Presbyters in one City provided ſufficiently for ordination in the reſt? or laſtly ſince this ordination is made ſo inſignificant by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> why might not theſe Believers have appointed their own Teachers without any further circumſtance; and by an inſtance of their power have freed Poſterity from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of thinking Apoſtolical Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſucceſſion ſo requiſite to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize Paſtors? But ſince the Apoſtles or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained all Eccleſiaſtical Officers by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or their <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> their Aſſiſtants, their ſuffragan Biſhops, and left ſome of them on purpoſe to do this work, it is plain that they conceived ſome kind of neceſſity for it, and did not look upon the power ſo common or inſignificant, as later projectors of Church ſettlements would make us believe.</p>
               <p>Now as the Scripture diſcovers no other ſort of Epiſcopacy, than ſuch as we have diſcribed; ſo the ancient Biſhops knew of no other Original of their Office, for they conceived themſelves to be derived from the Apoſtles, not as ordinary Presbyters or Deacon, but to ſucceed them in ſuch a

He informs us in the following words: <hi>Before it was ſaid, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollos, <hi>and I of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas:</hi>
                  <pb n="481" facs="tcp:64435:280"/>If we underſtand this according to the letter, we muſt conclude this to be very early: For this Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where that diviſion is mentioned, was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the year of Chriſt 52: And then this notion will do little ſervice againſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy: for this will make it of Apoſtolick inſtitution. Beſides I do not ſee how it can be true: for the Church was now Governed by Apoſtles, and not by Presbyters: and if in moſt Cities there were no particular Biſhop ordained yet, it was becauſe the Apoſtles were their Biſhops, and viſited them to eſtabliſh good order, to ordain officers, to puniſh the diſorderly, as they had opportunity; and when they were not able to be preſent, they ſent their orders in writing, and exerciſed Epiſcopal Authority at a diſtance: But <hi>Blondel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends earneſtly againſt the literal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that paſſage, and ſhews that <hi>Jerom</hi> could not mean this of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> but of ſome following Schiſm that ſprung up after the example of this of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> His reaſon is, that the paſſages where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Jerom</hi> confirms his opinion of Biſhops and Presbyters being the ſame, were written after that Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> I have ſhewed before how probable it is that <hi>Jerom</hi> ſpoke without a figure; and I need not repeat it here. <hi>But theſe things you will ſay cannot can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt.</hi> It may be ſo: and it is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that <hi>Jerom</hi> when he wrote this paſſage, did conſider in what order of time St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s

Nay we may be aſſured in this point that he had none from that <hi>Catalogue</hi> of writers we are ſpeaking of, ſince he had ſeen none but what <hi>Euſebius</hi> had ſeen before him, and cites as we have ſhewed before for the contrary opinion, to confirm Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy to be Apoſtolical, and to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun long before this time, which <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> would have <hi>Jerom</hi> thought to aſſign for its Original.

               <p>And ſince moſt of the Remains of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writings do either concern Religion in general, and are taken up in the defence of it againſt Idolatry, and Blaſphemous He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies; or elſe in giving ſome account of the general adminiſtration of the Church, by Biſhops met in Councils: we muſt try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may not ground a probable compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Biſhopricks of thoſe times in ſome Provinces, upon the number of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops that uſually met there, to determine ſuch things as concerned the general Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the peace not only of the Churches within ſuch a diſtrict, but alſo the Church U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal.</p>
               <p>Now the Church of <hi>Africk</hi> at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time ſtands in the beſt light of any, which is owing to the excellent writings of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who gives ſeveral particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſtate of the Churches of that part of the world in and before his time.

<pb n="515" facs="tcp:64435:297"/>to Metropolitans, and the Decrees of their Synods did, and could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige only ſuch as were preſent and conſented to them; it was neceſſary that all ſhould come together or ſend their Proxy, in order to eſtabliſh that Unity among them which was the deſign of theſe Councils, and yet all the number even of their moſt ſolemn Councils is not great. 3. The practice of the <hi>African</hi> Church within half an àge after this time confirms this inference from the number of the Biſhops at Councils, to the number of Dioceſes in that Country: for we find preſently, as Biſhopricks were multiplyed by the Schiſm of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> ſo Councils became much more numerous: and whereas ninety was the greateſt number that ever met there before this Schiſm, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we find ſeveral hundreds. But however this inference will hold, it is ſome comfort to find ſome others of great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and judgement in antiquity to hold the concluſion: that the number of Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks was not great in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time; which is aſſigned as a reaſon why his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was ſo large.<note place="margin">Aucto numero ſedium Epiſcopalium, adeo ut omnibus invigilare haud facile eſſet Carthag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to make this point clear beyond all exception, I will indeavour to ſhew from unqueſtionable teſtimonies, how Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks came to be multiplyed in <hi>Africk</hi> more than in any other part: and then notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:64435:298"/>this, I will make it evident that thoſe Biſhops were Dioceſans, and ſome of them after the crumbling of that Church into ſmall pieces, had yet very large Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſes, not inferiour to moſt of ours for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Territory.</p>
               <p>The Schiſm of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> though it broke not forth with any violence till after <hi>Caecilianus</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> yet it was hatching long before in the time of <hi>Menſurius,</hi>

               <p>Some time after when they quarrelled among themſelves, they called a Council of three hundred and ten, <hi>Bagatenſe</hi> againſt <hi>Maximianus.</hi> The Catholicks obſerving what advantage this reputation of having a great number of Biſhops gave their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,<note place="margin">Conc.

But it was commonly at the coſt of the Schiſmaticks that they multiplyed Dioceſes; for where there were two Biſhops in a Dioceſs, the one a <hi>Catholick</hi> and the other a <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> would return to the unity of the Church,<note place="margin">Codex Can. <hi>118.</hi>

<pb n="530" facs="tcp:64435:305"/>only for want of Chriſtians in all Cities and Villages, but by choice; and when they came afterwards to be multiplyed, it was not ſo much from the increaſe of believers, as from Schiſms and diviſions in the Church, and from the increaſe of Metropoles by the Chriſtian Emperors: in order to which I ſhall proceed upon the ſame grounds I have done hitherto. From the great number of Chriſtians that were diſperſed into all parts and Cities, and the ſmall number of Biſhops that met in Councils, eſpecially Provincial, where all were obliged to be preſent; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from ſome general expreſſions of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſome Biſhops in the earlieſt times, as it is to be preſumed that in the earlieſt times of the Church, the Provincial Synods were the majority at leaſt of the Biſhops in the ſeveral Provinces; ſo the firſt Synod had ſo few Biſhops that we muſt needs conclude their number then to be very ſmall.

               <p>However it is plain from hence, that there were but few Biſhops in compariſon of what they grew to within an hundred years after, and that I take to be an argument of the largeneſs of their Dioceſes.</p>

If we ſhall take this Province for a Civil diviſion, there will be yet greater abſurdity; for there may be other Metropolitans as well as he, and by what Authority could he diſpoſe of their Dioceſes or Provinces? In ſhort there he gives leave to Ordain Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters where the right of Ordaining them belonged to him; and that being in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Dioceſs only, it follows that this great Province was no other than his own Dioceſs or <hi>Parochia</hi> as he calls it alſo in the ſame paſſage.</p>
